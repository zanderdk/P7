The '''2006 Pacific hurricane season''' was the most active since [[2000 Pacific hurricane season|2000]], which also produced 19&nbsp;[[tropical cyclone|tropical storms]] or hurricanes.<ref name="epachurdat"/> Eighteen developed within the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) area of warning responsibility, which is east of [[140th meridian west|140°W]], and one storm formed between [[140th meridian west|140°W]] and the [[International Date Line]], which is under the jurisdiction of the [[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]] (CPHC). Of the 19&nbsp;total storms, eleven became hurricanes, of which six attained [[tropical cyclone scales|major hurricane status]]. Within the NHC portion of the basin, the season officially began on May 15, and in the CPHC portion, it started on June 1; the season officially ended on November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the eastern [[Pacific hurricane|Pacific basin]].

The strongest storm of the season was [[Hurricane Ioke]], which reached [[List of Category 5 Pacific hurricanes|Category 5]] status on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Saffir-Simpson scale]] in the central Pacific Ocean; Ioke passed near [[Johnston Atoll]] and later [[Wake Island]], where it caused heavy damage but no deaths. The deadliest storm of the season was [[Hurricane John (2006)|Hurricane John]], which killed six people after striking the [[Baja California Peninsula]], and the costliest storm was [[Hurricane Lane (2006)|Hurricane Lane]], which caused $203&nbsp;million in damage in southwestern Mexico (2006&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]], ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|203000000|2006}}}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD).

Seasonal activity began on May 27 when [[Tropical Storm Aletta (2006)|Tropical Storm Aletta]] formed off the southwest coast of Mexico. No storms formed in June, though the season became active in July when five named storms developed, including [[Hurricane Daniel (2006)|Hurricane Daniel]] which was the second strongest storm of the season, as well as [[Tropical Storm Emilia (2006)|Tropical Storm Emilia]]. During August, Hurricanes Ioke and John formed, as well as four other storms. September was a relatively quiet month with two storms, of which one was Hurricane Lane. Three storms developed in October including [[Hurricane Paul (2006)|Hurricane Paul]] and two formed in November; this marked the second time on record, after [[1961 Pacific hurricane season|1961]], when more than one tropical storm developed in the basin during the month of November.

On May 22, 2006, the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]'s (NOAA) [[Climate Prediction Center|CPC]] (CPC) released their forecasts for the 2006 [[2006 Atlantic hurricane season|Atlantic]] and Pacific hurricane seasons. The Pacific season was expected to be hindered by the decades-long cycle that began in [[1995 Pacific hurricane season|1995]], which generally increased [[wind shear]] across the basin. NOAA predicted a below-normal level of activity in the Eastern Pacific, with 12–16&nbsp;named storms, of which 6–8 were expected to become hurricanes, and 1–3 expected to become major hurricanes.<ref name="NOAA May">{{cite web|author=Climate Prediction Center, [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] |date=May 22, 2006 |title=NOAA Expects Below Average 2006 East Pacific Hurricane Season |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |accessdate=May 22, 2006 |url=http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2006/may06/noaa06-054.html |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wfdD8eyi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.publicaffairs.noaa.gov%2Freleases2006%2Fmay06%2Fnoaa06-054.html |archivedate=February 21, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref> The [[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]]'s [[area of responsibility]] was also expected to be below average, with only two to three tropical cyclones expected to form or cross into the area.<ref name="NOAA May CP">{{cite web|author=Central Pacific Hurricane Center, [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] |date=May 22, 2006 |title=NOAA Announces Central Pacific Hurricane Season Outlook |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |accessdate=June 10, 2006 |url=http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2006/may06/noaa06-r254.html |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wfdDKYow?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.publicaffairs.noaa.gov%2Freleases2006%2Fmay06%2Fnoaa06-r254.html |archivedate=February 21, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref> They expected that neither [[El Niño Southern Oscillation|El Niño]] nor La Niña would affect conditions significantly.<ref name="NOAA May"/>

No tropical storms developed in June in the basin, which was unusual compared to the average of two storms forming during the month. Since 1966, there have been only three other seasons in which a tropical storm did not form in June, these being [[1969 Pacific hurricane season|1969]], [[2004 Pacific hurricane season|2004]], and [[2007 Pacific hurricane season|2007]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Beven|date=July 1, 2007|title=June Monthly Weather Tropical Summary|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=September 5, 2008|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/tws/MIATWSEP_jun.shtml?| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080922220858/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/tws/MIATWSEP_jun.shtml| archivedate= September 22, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no|display-authors=etal}}</ref> After such an inactive month, the tropics became active in July when five named storms developed, including [[Hurricane Daniel (2006)|Hurricane Daniel]] which was the second strongest storm of the season.

An [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] storm persisted in the extreme northern central Pacific Ocean in late October. It drifted over unusually [[sea surface temperature|warm waters]] up to 3.6&nbsp;°F (2&nbsp;°C) above normal, and gradually developed convection near the center. By November 2, [[QuikSCAT]] satellite suggested the system attained winds of up to 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h) about 900&nbsp;mi (1450&nbsp;km) west of [[Oregon]]. The system also developed an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] and an eyewall. The cyclone tracked northeastward as it gradually weakened, and dissipated on November 4. [[NASA]] considered the cyclone to be a [[subtropical cyclone|subtropical storm]]. However, as it formed outside of the territory of any monitoring organization, it was not named. Operationally, the [[United States Navy]] treated the system as a tropical disturbance, numbered 91C.<ref name="NASA-91C">{{cite web|author=David Herring |publisher=NASA |title=Subtropical Storm off the Coast of Oregon |date=November 2, 2006 |accessdate=December 11, 2007 |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/natural_hazards_v2.php3?img_id=13951 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wfdFHGPB?url=http%3A%2F%2Fearthobservatory.nasa.gov%2FNaturalHazards%2Fnatural_hazards_v2.php3%3Fimg_id%3D13951 |archivedate=February 21, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref>

On September&nbsp;13, a tropical disturbance located about 125&nbsp;miles (200&nbsp;km) west-southwest of [[Acapulco]], Mexico, gradually became better organized and was designated the thirteenth tropical depression of the 2006&nbsp;season. The depression intensified in a favorable environment, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Lane later that night. As it moved parallel to the Mexican coast it continued to strengthen and became a hurricane on September&nbsp;15, and a major hurricane early the next day. Hurricane Lane reached peak winds of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h) before it made landfall on the coast of [[Sinaloa]] on September&nbsp;16.

A disturbance associated with a northerly extension of the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] and a tropical wave developed a closed circulation on September&nbsp;15. It moved northeastward due to the influence from nearby Hurricane Lane, and organized enough to be declared Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on September&nbsp;16 while located about 500&nbsp;miles southwest of [[Cabo San Lucas]], Mexico. It quickly strengthened, and organized into Tropical Storm Miriam later that day. After reaching a peak intensity of 45&nbsp;mph (70&nbsp;km/h), vertical wind shear and cooler waters rapidly weakened the storm, and the circulation decoupled from the convection on September&nbsp;17. After turning more towards the north, Miriam weakened to tropical depression status, and on September&nbsp;18 it degenerated to a remnant low. The remnant circulation turned to the northwest, then to the east, and dissipated on September&nbsp;21 a short distance west of [[Baja California]].

On September&nbsp;19, an area of disturbed weather associated with the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] became sufficiently organized to be designated Tropical Depression Two-C.

Initially, the depression was in an area of favorable conditions, with little wind shear and warm waters.<ref name="cphc"/> As a result, the CPHC predicted significant strengthening to at least hurricane status.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tanabe/Houston|date=2006-09-19|title=Tropical Depression Two-C Discussion Three|publisher=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|accessdate=2010-04-15|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/tcpages/archive/2006/TCDCP3.CP022006.3.0609191500}}</ref> Instead, a high pressure system to its north increased wind shear over the depression, causing the convection to become removed from the center.

During September, [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño]] conditions became established across the Pacific, which produced an area of warmer waters along the International Date Line. A few days after Tropical Depression Two-C dissipated, another area of disturbed weather formed, and although it was disorganized, it was also persistent. The CPHC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Three-C on September&nbsp;26 after a circulation was evident in the system.

In the middle of October, the Intertropical Convergence Zone extended across the central Pacific Ocean, resembling an extension of the [[monsoon trough]]. An area of disturbed weather formed well to the southwest of Hawaii, organizing slowly for several days. Late on October&nbsp;13, after the development of a low-level circulation and persistent convection, the CPHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Four-C about 750&nbsp;mi (1,200&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Honolulu, Hawaii]]. Upon being classified, the depression was located in an unusual [[tropical cyclone#Steering winds|steering flow]] that caused it to track eastward. Due to the approach of an upper-level [[trough (meteorology)|trough]], it was expected to dissipate quickly from [[wind shear]], although forecasters noted the possibility for the trough to provide an [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] channel, which might allow strengthening.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andy Nash|date=2006-10-13|title=Tropical Depression Four-C Discussion One|publisher=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|accessdate=2009-01-05|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/tcpages/archive/2006/TCDCP5.CP042006.1.0610132051}}</ref> On October&nbsp;14, strong wind shear removed the convection completely from the center, and the system degenerated into a remnant low.<ref name="cphc"/>

A tropical wave moved off the western coast of Africa on October&nbsp;21, briefly developing two weak low pressure areas before the wave crossed into the Pacific Ocean on November&nbsp;1. Thunderstorm activity slowly increased as the wave interacted within the Intertropical Convergence Zone. After a curved band of convection developed, it is estimated the system formed into Tropical Depression Twenty-E around 0000&nbsp;UTC on November&nbsp;11, about 550&nbsp;mi (1,050&nbsp;km) southwest of Manzanillo.

Just days after Tropical Depression Twenty-E degenerated into an open trough, Tropical Depression Twenty One-E developed from a [[tropical wave]] on November&nbsp;13 about 460&nbsp;miles (740&nbsp;km) south of [[Manzanillo, Colima]]. It steadily intensified as it tracked southeastward, reaching peak winds of 110&nbsp;mph (175&nbsp;km/h) on November&nbsp;15. Subsequently it began to weaken due to increased [[wind shear]] as it turned to the north. Sergio later turned to the west, remaining well off the coast of [[Mexico]], and it dissipated on November&nbsp;20 about 320&nbsp;miles (515&nbsp;km) west-northwest of where it originally formed.<ref name="stcr">{{cite web|author1=Richard Pasch  |author2=David Roberts|year=2006|title=Hurricane Sergio Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-02-13|url={{NHC TCR url|id=EP212006_Sergio}}|format=PDF}}</ref>

Sergio produced light rainfall along the coast of Mexico, though its effects were minimal.<ref name="sergiosmn">{{cite web|author=Servicio Meteorológico Nacional|year=2006|title=Resumen del Huracan "Sergio" del Océano Pacífic|accessdate=2007-02-13|language=Spanish|url=http://smn.cna.gob.mx/ciclones/tempo2006/pacifico/sergio.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> The formation of Sergio marked the 2006 season as the most active in 12&nbsp;years and the second season in which more than one tropical storm formed in November, after [[1961 Pacific hurricane season|1961]].

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all the damage figures are in 2006 USD.
