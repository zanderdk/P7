'''''Stegosaurus''''' ({{IPAc-en|?|s|t|?|g|?|'|s|??r|?|s}}<ref>{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Stegosaurus}}</ref>) is a genus of [[Thyreophora|armored]] [[dinosaur]]. Their [[fossil]] bones have been found in rocks dated to the [[Late Jurassic]] [[Period (geology)|period]] ([[Kimmeridgian]] to early [[Tithonian]] ages), between 155 and 150&nbsp;[[Mya (unit)|million years ago]], in the western [[United States]] and [[Portugal]]. Several species have been classified in the upper [[Morrison Formation]] of the western U.S, though only three are universally recognized; '''''S. stenops''''', '''''S. ungulatus''''' and '''''S. sulcatus'''''. The remains of over 80 individual animals of this genus have been found.<ref name=turner1999>Turner, C.E. and Peterson, F., (1999). "Biostratigraphy of dinosaurs in the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of the Western Interior, U.S.A." Pp. 77–114 in Gillette, D.D. (ed.), ''Vertebrate Paleontology in Utah''. Utah Geological Survey Miscellaneous Publication 99-1.</ref> ''Stegosaurus'' would have lived alongside dinosaurs such as ''[[Apatosaurus]]'', ''[[Diplodocus]]'', ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'', ''[[Allosaurus]]'' and ''[[Ceratosaurus]]''; the latter two may have been predators of it.

These were a large, heavily built, [[herbivore|herbivorous]] [[quadruped]]s with rounded backs, short fore limbs, long hind limbs, and tails held high in the air. Due to their distinctive combination of broad, upright plates and tail tipped with [[Thagomizer|spikes]], ''Stegosaurus'' is one of the most recognizable kinds of dinosaur. The function of this array of plates and spikes has been the subject of much speculation among scientists. Today, it is generally agreed that their spikes were most likely used for defense against predators, while their plates may have been used primarily for display, and secondarily for [[thermoregulation|thermoregulatory]] functions. ''Stegosaurus'' had a relatively low [[brain-to-body mass ratio]]. It had a short neck and a small head, meaning it most likely ate low-lying bushes and shrubs. One species, ''Stegosaurus ungulatus'', is the largest known of all the stegosaurians (bigger than related dinosaurs such as ''[[Kentrosaurus]]'' and ''[[Huayangosaurus]]'').

''Stegosaurus'' remains were first identified during the "[[Bone Wars]]" by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]]. The first known skeletons were fragmentary and the bones were scattered, and it would be many years before the true appearance of these animals, including their posture and plate arrangement, became well understood. The name ''Stegosaurus'' means "roof lizard" or "covered lizard", in reference to its bony plates.<ref name=OnlineEtDict>{{cite web|title=stegosaurus|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=stegosaurus&allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}</ref> Despite its popularity in books and film, mounted skeletons of ''Stegosaurus'' did not become a staple of major natural history museums until the mid-20th century, and many museums have had to assemble composite displays from several different specimens due to a lack of complete skeletons.

== Description ==
[[File:Stegosaurus armatus scale.png|thumb|left|201px|Size of ''S.&nbsp;ungulatus'' (orange) and ''S. stenops'' (green) compared to a human]]
The quadrupedal ''Stegosaurus'' is one of the most easily identifiable dinosaur genera, due to the distinctive double row of kite-shaped plates rising vertically along the rounded back and the two pairs of long spikes extending horizontally near the end of the tail. Although large individuals could grow up to {{convert|9|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} in length,<ref name="Holtz2008">Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2012) ''Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages,'' [http://www.geol.umd.edu/~tholtz/dinoappendix/HoltzappendixWinter2011.pdf Winter 2011 Appendix.]</ref> the various species of ''Stegosaurus'' were dwarfed by their contemporaries, the giant [[Sauropoda|sauropods]]. Some form of [[Armour (zoology)|armor]] appears to have been necessary, as ''Stegosaurus'' species coexisted with large predatory theropod dinosaurs, such as ''[[Allosaurus]]'' and ''[[Ceratosaurus]]''.

Most of the information known about ''Stegosaurus'' comes from the remains of mature animals; more recently, though, juvenile remains of ''Stegosaurus'' have been found. One subadult specimen, discovered in 1994 in Wyoming, is {{convert|4.6|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, and is estimated to have weighed 2.4&nbsp;metric tons (2.6&nbsp;short tons) while alive.

=== Skull ===
[[File:Stegosaurus stenops skull cast - Natural History Museum of Utah - DSC07228.JPG|thumb|''S.&nbsp;stenops'' skull cast, Natural History Museum of Utah]]
The long and narrow [[skull]] was small in proportion to the body. It had a small [[antorbital fenestra]], the hole between the nose and eye common to most [[archosaur]]s, including modern birds, though lost in extant crocodylians. The skull's low position suggests that ''Stegosaurus'' may have been a browser of low-growing vegetation. This interpretation is supported by the absence of front teeth and their likely replacement by a horny beak or [[beak#Anatomy|rhamphotheca]]. The lower jaw of ''Stegosaurus'' had a flat upward extension that would have completely hidden the teeth when viewed from the side, and which probably supported a turtle-like beak in life.<ref name=knoll2008>Knoll, F.

Despite the animal's overall size, the braincase of ''Stegosaurus'' was small, being no larger than that of a dog. A well-preserved ''Stegosaurus'' braincase allowed [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] to obtain, in the 1880s, a cast of the brain cavity or endocast of the animal, which gave an indication of the brain size. The endocast showed the brain was indeed very small, the smallest proportionally of all dinosaur endocasts then known. The fact that an animal weighing over 4.5&nbsp;[[tonne|metric tons]] (5&nbsp;[[short tons]]) could have a brain of no more than {{convert|80|g|oz|abbr=on}} contributed to the popular old idea that all dinosaurs were unintelligent, an idea now largely rejected.<ref name =bakker86b>{{cite book|title=The Dinosaur Heresies|year=1986|author=Bakker RT|publisher=William Morrow, New York |pages=365–74}}</ref> Actual brain anatomy in ''Stegosaurus'' is poorly known, but the brain itself was, however, small even for a dinosaur, fitting well with a slow, herbivorous lifestyle and limited behavioural complexity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Buchholtz |first=Emily |last2=Holtz |first2=Thomas R., Jr. |last3=Farlow |first3=James O. |last4=Walters |first4=Bob |editor-last=Brett-Surman |editor-first=M.K. |title=The complete dinosaur |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington, Ind. |isbn=978-0-253-00849-7 |edition=2nd |url=http://www.google.no/books?hl=no&lr=&id=pX_l24sDARwC&oi=fnd&pg=PA191&dq=stegosaurus+brain+intelligence&ots=W4wYavmVri&sig=L_93Z6f8BWSWlQKWdKpCx8oFhjI&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=stegosaurus%20brain%20intelligence&f=false |accessdate=27 February 2013 |page=201 |quote=Proportions and anatomy of endocasts of ''Stegosaurus'' vary little from those of ancestral archosaurs, with an elongated shape, large olfractory lobes, and extremely narrow cerebral hemispheres.

=== Skeleton ===
[[File:Stegosaurus ungulatus.jpg|thumb|Mounted composite skeleton referred to ''S. ungulatus'', [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]]]]
In ''Stegosaurus stenops'' there are 27 bones in the [[vertebral column]] [[anatomical terms of location#Anterior and posterior|anterior]] to the [[sacrum]], a varying number of vertebrae in the sacrum, with four in most subadults, and around 46 caudal (tail) vertebrae. The presacrals are divided into cervical (neck) and dorsal (back) vertebrae, with around 10 cervicals and 17 dorsals, the total number being one greater than in ''[[Hesperosaurus]]'', two greater than ''[[Huayangosaurus]]'', although ''[[Miragaia]]'' preserves 17 cervicals and an unknown number of dorsals. The first cervical vertebra is the [[axis bone]], which is connected and often fused to the [[atlas bone]]. Farther posteriorly, the proportionately larger the cervicals become, although they do not change greatly in anything other than size. Past the first few dorsals, the [[vertebral centrum|centrum]] of the bones become more elongate front-to-back, and the [[wikt:transverse|transverse]] processes become more elevated [[anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal]]. The sacrum of ''S. stenops'' includes four sacral vertebrae, but one of the dorsals is also incorporated into the structure. In some specimens of ''S. stenops'', a caudal is also incorporated, as a caudosacral. In ''[[Hesperosaurus]]'' there are two dorsosacrals, and only four fused sacrals, but in ''[[Kentrosaurus]]'' there may be as many as seven vertebrae in the sacrum, with both dorsosacrals and caudosacrals. ''S. stenops'' preserves 46 caudal vertebrae, and up to 49, and along the series both the centrums and the [[neural spines]] become smaller, until the neural spines disappear at caudal 35. Around the middle of the tail, the neural spines become [[wikt:bifurcation|bifurcated]], meaning they are divided near the top.<ref name="maidmentetal15">{{cite journal|first1=S. C.

With multiple well-preserved skeletons, ''S. stenops'' preserves all regions of the body, including the limbs. The [[scapula]] (shoulder blade) is sub-rectangular, with a robust blade. Though it is not always perfectly preserved, the [[acromion]] ridge is slightly larger than in ''Kentrosaurus''. The blade is relatively straight, although it curves towards the back. There is a small bump on the back of the blade, that would have served as the base of the ''[[triceps]]'' muscle. Articulated with the scapula, the [[coracoid]] is sub-circular.<ref name="maidmentetal15" /> The hind feet each had three short toes, while each fore foot had five toes; only the inner two toes had a blunt hoof. The phalangeal formula is 2-2-2-2-1, meaning the innermost finger of the fore limb has two bones, the next has two, etc.<ref>Martin, A.J. (2006). Introduction to the Study of Dinosaurs.

=== Plates ===
[[File:Stegosaurus stenops sophie wiki martyniuk.png|thumb|201px|right|Life restoration of ''S. stenops'' based on the "Sophie" specimen by Matthew Martyniuk, 2015.]]
The most recognizable features of ''Stegosaurus'' are its dermal plates, which consisted of between 17 and 22 separate plates and flat spines.<ref name=revan2011/> These were highly modified [[osteoderms]] (bony-cored scales), similar to those seen in crocodiles and many lizards today. They were not directly attached to the animal's skeleton, instead arising from the skin. The largest plates were found over the hips and could measure up to {{convert|60|cm|ft|abbr=on}} wide and 60&nbsp;cm tall.

In a 2010 review of ''Stegosaurus'' species, Peter Galton suggested that the arrangement of the plates on the back may have varied between species, and that the pattern of plates as viewed in profile may have been important for species recognition. Galton noted that the plated in ''S. stenops'' have been found articulated in two staggered rows, rather than paired. Fewer ''S. ungulatus'' plates have been found, and none articulated, making the arrangement in this species more difficult to determine. However, the type specimen of ''S. ungulatus'' preserves two flattened spine-like plates from the tail that are nearly identical in shape and size, but are mirror images of each other, suggesting that at least these were arranged in pairs.<ref name=galton2010 />

== Discovery and history ==
''Stegosaurus'', one of the many dinosaurs first collected and described in the [[Bone Wars]], was originally named by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] in 1877,<ref name="Marsh77">{{cite journal|author=Marsh OC|year=1877|title=A new order of extinct Reptilia (Stegosauria) from the Jurassic of the Rocky Mountains|journal=American Journal of Science|volume=3|issue=14|pages=513–514}}</ref> from remains recovered north of [[Morrison, Colorado]]. These first bones became the [[holotype]] of ''Stegosaurus armatus''. Marsh initially believed the remains were from an aquatic turtle-like animal, and the basis for its [[binomial nomenclature|scientific name]], 'roof(ed) lizard' was due to his early belief that the plates lay flat over the animal's back, overlapping like the [[Roof shingle|shingles]] ([[tile]]s) on a roof. A wealth of ''Stegosaurus'' material was recovered over the next few years, and Marsh published several papers on the genus from 1877 to 1897.<ref name="gilmore14"/> In 1878, [[Edward Drinker Cope]] named ''[[Hypsirhophus discurus]]'', as another stegosaurian based on fragmentary fossils specimens from Cope’s Quarry 3 near the "Cope's Nipple" site in [[Garden Park, Colorado]].<ref name=biostrat_morrison>Carpenter, K. (1998). Vertebrate biostratigraphy of the Morrison Formation near Canon City, Colorado. ''Modern Geology'', '''23''': 407-426.</ref> Many later researchers have considered ''Hypsirhophus'' to be a synonym of ''Stegosaurus'',<ref name="gilmore14"/> though Peter Galton (2010) suggested that it is distinct based on differences in the vertebrae.<ref name=galton2010 />

[[image:Roadkill_Stegosaurus_stenops.jpg|thumb|left|Type specimen of ''S. stenops'' on display in 2008 at the [[National Museum of Natural History]].]]
Marsh named a second species, ''Stegosaurus ungulatus'', in 1879, and finally gave a more detailed description of all the ''Stegosaurus'' fossils collected to far the following year.<ref name=galton2010 /> In 1881, he named a third species ''Stegosaurus'' "affinis", based only on a hip bone. This species is generally agreed to have been inadequately described, and therefore is a ''[[nomen nudum]]'' (a name lacking a formal description). The specimen was later lost.<ref name=galton2010 /> Marsh continued to collect and examine new ''Stegosaurus'' specimens, and in 1887 he named three new species: ''Stegosaurus stenops'', ''S. duplex'', and ''S. sulcatus''.<ref name="gilmore14"/> Though it had not yet been completely prepared, the nearly complete and articulated type specimen of ''Stegosaurus stenops'' allowed Marsh to complete the first attempt at a reconstructed ''Stegosaurus'' skeleton. This first reconstruction, of ''S. ungulatus'' with missing parts filled in from ''S. stenops'', was published by Marsh in 1891. (In 1893, [[Richard Lydekker]] mistakenly re-published Marsh's drawing under the label ''Hypsirhophus'').<ref name="gilmore14"/>

[[File:Stego-marsh-1896-US geological survey.png|thumb|Marsh's 1891 illustration of ''S.&nbsp;ungulatus'': Note the single row of 12 large rounded plates, based on those of ''S. stenops'', and eight spikes]]
The next species of ''Stegosaurus'' to be named was ''S. marshi'', by Frederick Lucas in 1901. Lucas reclassified this species in the new genus ''[[Hoplitosaurus]]'' later that year. Lucas also re-examined the issue of the life appearance of ''Stegosaurus'', coming to the conclusion that the plates were arranged in pairs in two rows along the back, arranged above the bases of the ribs. Lucas commissioned [[Charles R. Knight]] to produce a life restoration of ''S. ungulatus'' based on his new interpretation. However, the following year, Lucas wrote that he now believed the plates were probably attached in staggered rows.<ref name="gilmore14"/> In 1910, [[Richard Swann Lull]] wrote that the alternating pattern seen in ''S. stenops'' was probably due to shifting of the skeleton after death. He led the construction of the first ever ''Stegosaurus'' skeletal mount at the [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]], which was depicted with paired plates.<ref name="gilmore14"/> In 1914, Charles Gilmore argued against Lull's interpretation, noting that several specimens of ''S. stenops'', including the now-completely prepared holotype, preserved the plates in alternating rows near the peak of the back, and that there was no evidence of the plates having shifted relative to the body during fossilization.<ref name="gilmore14"/> Gilmore and Lucas' interpretation became the generally accepted standard, and Lull's mount at the Peabody Museum was changed to reflect this in 1924.<ref name=revan2011/>

===Plate arrangement===
One of the major subjects of books and articles about ''Stegosaurus'' is the plate arrangement.<ref>{{cite book|title=Dinosaurs: Their Discovery & Their World|year=1962|author=Colbert EH|pages=82–99|publisher=Hutchinson Press, London|isbn=1-111-21503-0}}</ref> The argument has been a major one in the history of dinosaur reconstruction. Four possible plate arrangements have been proposed over the years:

[[File:Stego.jpg|thumb|right|1901 life restoration of ''S. ungulatus'' by [[Charles R. Knight]] with paired dorsal plates and eight tail spikes]]
* The plates lie flat along the back, as a [[Roof shingle|shingle]]-like armor. This was Marsh's initial interpretation, which led to the name 'roof lizard'. As further and complete plates were found, their form showed they stood on edge, rather than lying flat.
* By 1891, Marsh published a more familiar view of ''Stegosaurus'',<ref name="Marsh1891" /> with a single row of plates. This was dropped fairly early on (apparently because it was poorly understood how the plates were embedded in the skin and they were thought to overlap too much in this arrangement). It was revived, in somewhat modified form, in the 1980s, by Stephen Czerkas,<ref>{{cite book|title=Dinosaurs Past & Present, Vol 2|year=1987|chapter=A Reevaluation of the Plate Arrangement on ''Stegosaurus stenops''|veditors=Czerkas SJ, Olson EC |author=Czerkas SA|pages=82–99|publisher=University of Washington Press, Seattle|id=ISBN }}</ref> based on the arrangement of [[iguana]] dorsal spines.
* The plates were paired in a double row along the back. This is probably the most common arrangement in illustrations, especially earlier ones. The ''Stegosaurus'' in the 1933 film, ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', has this arrangement.
* Two rows of alternating plates. By the early 1960s, this had become (and remains) the prevalent idea, mainly because some ''S. stenops'' fossils in which the plates are still partially articulated show this arrangement.

=== Species ===
Initially, several species were described. However, many of these have since been considered to be invalid or synonymous with existing species,<ref name="8spike">{{cite book|title=The Armored Dinosaurs |year=2001 |chapter=Othniel Charles Marsh and the Eight-Spiked ''Stegosaurus'' |editor=Carpenter, Kenneth |vauthors=Carpenter K, Galton PM |pages=76–102 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0-253-33964-2}}</ref> leaving two well-known and one poorly known species.

These spine-like plates appear to have been paired, due to the presence of at least one pair that are identical but mirrored. ''S. ungulatus'' also appears to have had longer legs (femora) and hip bones than other species. The type specimen of ''S. ungulatus'' was discovered with eight spikes, though they were scattered away from their original positions. These have often been interpreted as indicating that the animal had four pairs of tail spikes. No specimens have been found with complete or articulated sets of tail spikes, but no additional specimens have been found that preserve eight spikes together. It is possible the extra pair of spikes came from a different individual, and though no other extra bones were found with the specimen, these may be found if more digging were done at the original site.<ref name=galton2010 /> Specimens from other quarries (such as a tail from Quarry 13, now forming part of the composite skeleton AMNH 650 at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]), referred to ''S. ungulatus'' on the basis of their notched tail vertebrae, are preserved with only four tail spikes.<ref name=8spike/> The type specimen of ''S. ungulatus'' (YPM 1853) was incorporated into the first ever mounted skeleton of a stegosaur at the [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]] in 1910 by [[Richard Swann Lull]].

This is the best-known species of ''Stegosaurus'', mainly because its remains include at least one complete articulated skeleton. It had proportionately large, broad plates and rounded tail plates. Articulated specimens show that the plates were arranged alternating in a staggered double row. ''S. stenops'' is known from at least 50&nbsp;partial skeletons of adults and juveniles, one complete skull, and four partial skulls. It was shorter than other species, at {{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

=== Doubtful species and junior synonyms ===
* ''Stegosaurus armatus'', meaning "armored roof lizard", was the first species to be found and the original type species named by O.C. Marsh in 1877.<ref name="Marsh77" /> It is known from a partial skeletons, and more than 30 fragmentary specimens have been referred to it.<ref name="dinosauria04"/> However, the [[type specimen]] was very fragmentary, consisting only of a partial tail, hips, and leg, parts of some back vertebrae, and a single fragmentary plate (the presence of which was used to give the animal its name). No other plates or spikes were found, and the entire front half of the animal appears not to have been preserved.<ref name="8spike" /> Because the type specimen is very fragmentary, it is extremely difficult to compare it with other species based on better specimens, and it is now generally considered to be a ''nomen dubium''. Because of this, it was replaced by ''S. stenops'' as the type species of ''Stegosaurus'' in a ruling of the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]] in 2013.<ref name=icznopinion2320>International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (2013).

* ''Stegosaurus'' "affinis", named by Marsh in 1881, is only known from a [[pubis (bone)|pubis]] which has since been lost.

* ''Stegosaurus duplex'', meaning "two plexus roof lizard" (in allusion to the greatly enlarged neural canal of the sacrum which Marsh characterized as a "posterior brain case"), was named by Marsh in 1887 (including the holotype specimen). The disarticulated bones were actually collected in 1879 by Edward Ashley at Como Bluff. Marsh initially distinguished it from ''S. ungulatus'' based on the fact that each sacral (hip) vertebra bore its own rib, which he claimed was unlike the anatomy of ''S. ungulatus''; however, the sacrum of ''S. ungulatus'' had not actually been discovered. Marsh also suggested that ''S. duplex'' may have lacked armor, since no plates or spikes were found with the specimen, though a single spike may actually have been present nearby, and re-examination of the site maps has shown that the entire specimen was found highly disarticulated and scattered.<ref name="8spike" /> It is generally considered a synonym of ''S. ungulatus'' today, and parts of the specimen were actually incorporated into the Peabody Museum ''S. ungulatus'' skeletal mount in 1910.<ref name=galton2010/>

== Classification ==
[[File:Stegosaurus BW.jpg|thumb|Restoration of ''S.&nbsp;ungulatus'' with alternating plate arrangement by Nobu Tamura, 2007.]]
''Stegosaurus'' was the first-named genus of the family [[Stegosauridae]]. It is the [[type genus]] that gives its name to the family. The Stegosauridae are one of two families within the infraorder [[Stegosauria]], with the other being the [[Huayangosauridae]]. The infraorder Stegosauria lies within the [[Thyreophora]], or [[Armour (zoology)|armored]] dinosaurs, a suborder which also includes the more diverse [[Ankylosauria|ankylosaurs]]. The stegosaurs were a [[clade]] of animals similar in appearance, posture, and shape that mainly differed in their array of spikes and plates. Among the closest relatives to ''Stegosaurus'' are ''[[Wuerhosaurus]]'' from [[China]] and ''[[Kentrosaurus]]'' from [[East Africa]].

The following [[cladogram]] shows the position of ''Stegosaurus'' within the Stegosauridae according to Mateus, 2009:<ref name=Mateus2009>{{cite journal|author1=O. Mateus |author2=S. C. R.

=== Origin ===
The origin of ''Stegosaurus'' is uncertain, as few remains of basal stegosaurs and their ancestors are known. Recently, stegosaurids have been shown to be present in the lower Morrison Formation, existing several million years before the occurrence of ''Stegosaurus'' itself, with the discovery of the related ''[[Hesperosaurus]]'' from the early [[Kimmeridgian]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Armored Dinosaurs|year=2001|chapter=New Primitive Stegosaur from the Morrison Formation, Wyoming|editor=Carpenter, Kenneth |vauthors=Carpenter K, Miles CA, Cloward K |pages=55–75|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-33964-2}}</ref> The earliest stegosaurid (the genus ''[[Lexovisaurus]]'') is known from the [[Oxford Clay]] Formation of England and France, giving it an age of early to middle [[Callovian]].

The earlier and more basal genus ''[[Huayangosaurus]]'' from the Middle Jurassic of China (some 165 million years ago – Mya) antedates ''Stegosaurus'' by 20 million years and is the only genus in the family Huayangosauridae. Earlier still is ''[[Scelidosaurus]]'', from Early Jurassic England, which lived about 190&nbsp;Mya. Interestingly, it possessed features of both stegosaurs and ankylosaurs. ''[[Emausaurus]]'' from Germany was another small quadruped, while ''[[Scutellosaurus]]'' from [[Arizona]] was an even earlier genus and was facultatively bipedal. These small, lightly armored dinosaurs were closely related to the direct ancestor of both stegosaurs and ankylosaurs. A trackway of a possible early armored dinosaur, from around 195 Mya, has been found in France.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Le Loeuff J, Lockley M, Meyer C, ((Petit J-P)) |year=1999 |title=Discovery of a thyreophoran trackway in the Hettangian of central France|journal=C.

== Paleobiology ==
[[File:Allosaurus attacks Stegosaurus.jpg|upright|thumb|Adult and juvenile ''S.&nbsp;stenops'' mounted as if under attack from an ''[[Allosaurus fragilis]]'', [[Denver Museum of Nature and Science]]]]
''Stegosaurus'' was the largest [[stegosauria|stegosaur]], possibly weighing up to 5,000&nbsp;kg (5.5&nbsp;tons).
Soon after its discovery, Marsh considered ''Stegosaurus'' to have been bipedal, due to its short forelimbs.<ref name="Marsh80">{{cite journal|last=Marsh |first=Othniel Charles|year=1880|title=Principal characters of American Jurassic dinosaurs, part III|journal=American Journal of Science |volume=3 |issue=19 |pages=253–59}}</ref> He had changed his mind, however, by 1891, after considering the heavy build of the animal.<ref name="Marsh1891">{{cite journal|last=Marsh |first=Othniel Charles|year=1891|title=Restoration of ''Stegosaurus''|journal=American Journal of Science|volume=3|issue=42|pages=179–81}}</ref>
Although ''Stegosaurus'' is undoubtedly now considered to have been quadrupedal, some discussion has occurred over whether it could have reared up on its hind legs, using its tail to form a tripod with its hind limbs, and browsing for higher foliage.<ref name="dinosauria04" /> This has been proposed by [[Robert Bakker|Bakker]]<ref name="bakker86" /><ref>{{cite journal|author=Bakker RT|year=1978|title=Dinosaur feeding behavior and the origin of flowering plants|journal=Nature|issue=274|pages=661–63|volume=274|doi=10.1038/274661a0|bibcode=1978Natur.274..661B}}</ref> and opposed by [[Kenneth Carpenter|Carpenter]].<ref name="Carpenter98" />

''Stegosaurus'' did have very short fore limbs, in relation to its hind legs. Furthermore, within the hind limbs, the lower section (comprising the [[tibia]] and [[fibula]]) was short compared with the [[femur]]. This suggests it could not walk very fast, as the stride of the back legs at speed would have overtaken the front legs, giving a maximum speed of {{convert|6|–|7|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref name="FasWeis04" />

Tracks discovered by Matthew Mossbrucker (Morrison Natural History Museum, Colorado) suggest that ''Stegosaurus'' lived in multiple-age herds. One group of tracks is interpreted as showing four or five baby stegosaurs moving in the same direction, while another has a juvenile stegosaur track with an adult track overprinting it.<ref name="smithsonian08">{{cite journal|last=Rajewski|first=Genevieve|date=May 2008|title=Where Dinosaurs Roamed |journal=Smithsonian |pages=20–24 |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/phenom-dino-200805.html |accessdate=2008-04-30}}</ref> ''Stegosaurus'' may have preferred drier settings than other common Morrison Formation dinosaurs, such as ''[[Allosaurus]]'', ''[[Apatosaurus]]'', ''[[Camarasaurus]]'', and ''[[Diplodocus]]''.<ref name=DBBM80>{{cite journal |last1=Dodson |first1=Peter |last2=Behrensmeyer |first2=A.K. |last3=Bakker |first3=Robert T. |last4=McIntosh |first4=John S. |year=1980 |title=Taphonomy and paleoecology of the dinosaur beds of the Jurassic Morrison Formation |journal=Paleobiology |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=208–232}}</ref>

=== Juveniles ===
Juveniles of ''Stegosaurus'' have been preserved, probably showing the growth of the genus. ''Kentrosaurus'' is also known from juvenile specimens, and they can be identified as different genders. The two juveniles are both relatively small, with the smaller individual being {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, and the larger having a length of {{convert|2.6|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The specimens can be identified as not mature because they lack the fusion of the [[scapula]] and [[coracoid]], and the lower hind limbs. Also, the [[pelvis|pelvic region]] of the specimens are similar to ''Kentrosaurus'' juveniles.<ref name="galton1982">{{cite journal|last=Galton|first=P.M.|year=1982|title=Juveniles of the stegosaurian dinosaur ''Stegosaurus'' from the Upper Jurassic of North America|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|volume=2|issue=1|pages=47–62|doi=10.1080/02724634.1982.10011917}}</ref>

=== Plate function ===
[[File:Stegosaurus dorsal plate - Museum of the Rockies - 2013-07-08.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Back plate cast, [[Museum of the Rockies]]]]
The function of ''Stegosaurus'' plates has been much debated. Initially thought of as some form of armor,<ref name="Marsh80" /> they appear to have been too fragile and ill-placed for defensive purposes, leaving the animal's sides unprotected.<ref name="Davitashvili61">{{cite book|title=The Theory of sexual selection|year=1961|author=Davitashvili L|page=538|publisher=Izdatel'stvo Akademia nauk SSSR}}</ref> The plates' large size suggests that they may have served to increase the apparent height of the animal, either to intimidate enemies<ref name="gilmore14" /> or to impress other members of the same species, in some form of sexual [[Display (zoology)|display]],<ref name="Davitashvili61" /> although both male and female specimens seemed to have had the same plates. More recently, researchers have proposed that they may have helped to control the body temperature of the animal,<ref name="Buff86" /> in a similar way to the sails of the [[pelycosaur]]s ''[[Dimetrodon]]'' and ''[[Edaphosaurus]]'' (and modern elephant and rabbit ears). The plates had blood vessels running through grooves and air flowing around the plates would have cooled the blood.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Farlow JO, Thompson CV, Rosner DE |year=1976|title=Plates of the dinosaur ''Stegosaurus'':Forced convection heat loss fins?|journal=Science|issue= 4244|pages=1123–25|volume=192|doi=10.1126/science.192.4244.1123|pmid=17748675|bibcode=1976Sci...192.1123F}}</ref> The publication of "Growth and Function of ''Stegosaurus'' Plates"<ref name="Buff86" /> by Buffrénil, et al. in 1986 marked a major step out of the realm of speculation and into the realm of science, with its microscopic analyses of multiple ''Stegosaurus'' plate specimens, proving unequivocally "extreme vascularization of the outer layer of bone",<ref name="Brusatte">{{cite book|title=Dinosaur Paleobiology|date=February 2012|author=Stephen Brusatte|pages=63–64|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|location=Hoboken, NJ}}</ref> which was seen by Buffrénil as further evidence the plates "acted as thermoregulatory devices".<ref name="Brusatte" /> Later, more comprehensive [[histology|histological]] surveys of plate microstructure attributed the vascularization to the need to transport nutrients for rapid plate growth, asserting the plates' physiology, if beneficial, was a side benefit secondary to their primary function, identification and [[Display (zoology)|display]].<ref name="Brusatte" /><ref name="platesforID" />

Some 2010 structural comparisons of ''Stegosaurus'' plates to ''[[Alligator]]'' osteoderms seem to support the conclusion that the potential for a thermoregulatory role in the plates of ''Stegosaurus'' definitely exists.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Farlow, James O. |author2=Hayashi, Shoji |author3=Tattersall, Glenn J. |title=Internal vascularity of the dermal plates of Stegosaurus (Ornithischia, Thyreophora)|year=2010|journal=Swiss J Geoscia|doi=10.1007/s00015-010-0021-5|volume=103|issue=2|pages=173–85|url=http://www.brocku.ca/researchers/glenn_tattersall/PDFs/farlow%20et%20al%20stegosaurus.pdf}}</ref> This hypothesis has been seriously questioned,<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Main RP, Padian K, Horner J |year=2000|title=Comparative histology, growth and evolution of archosaurian osteoderms: why did ''Stegosaurus'' have such large dorsal plates?|issue=20|journal= Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 56A}}</ref> since its closest relatives, such as ''Kentrosaurus'', had more low [[surface area]] spikes than plates, implying that cooling was not important enough to require specialized structural formations such as plates. Another possible function is that the plates may have helped the animal increase heat absorption from the sun. Since a cooling trend occurred towards the end of the Jurassic, a large ectothermic reptile might have used the increased surface area afforded by the plates to absorb radiation from the sun.

Another explanation for ''Stegosaurus'' plates' heavily vascular design is that, when under threat, blood could rush into the plates, causing them to "[[Blushing|blush]]" which would add a colorful, red warning, "embellishing"<ref name="blood2">{{cite conference | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CLEPeg_SjTcC&pg=PA137 |author=Carpenter, K. | title=Armor of ''Stegosaurus stenops'' and the taphonomic history of a new specimen from Garden Park, Colorado | publisher=Taylor & Francis | editor=Fraser, Nick | work=Morrison Symposium Proceedings |date=June 1998 | conference=Morrison Symposium | pages=137 | ISBN=978-9056991838}}</ref> the visual threat display.<ref name=blood>{{cite book|title= The Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation: an interdisciplinary study Part 2|author= Kenneth Carpenter|author2= Dan Chure|author3= James Ian Kirkland|author4= Denver Museum of Natural History|isbn=90-5699-183-3|page=137|year=1998|publisher=Taylor & Francis}}</ref> This "blushing capacity", instead of thermoregulatory functions, may be the plates' purpose,<ref name="Carpenter98" /> though the two functions certainly could have coexisted. That ''Stegosaurus'' plates could "blush" has become the predominant interpretation of plate function since the late 20th century, and is even depicted in the popular BBC documentary ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]'', with the sudden reddening of the plates used in conjunction with threatening swings of the spiked tail to intimidate and confuse an attacking ''[[Allosaurus]]''. Also, this blushing could have been used to attract mates.<ref name=blood /> A study published in 2005 supports the idea of their use in species identification. Researchers believe this may be the function of other unique anatomical features, found in various dinosaur species.<ref name="platesforID">{{cite journal|vauthors=Main R, de Ricqlès A, Horner JR, Padian K |year=2005|title= The evolution and function of thyreophoran dinosaur scutes: implications for plate function in stegosaurs|journal=Paleobiology|volume=31|issue=2|pages=291–314|doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2005)031[0291:teafot]2.0.co;2}}</ref>

In the past, some [[paleontology|palaeontologists]], notably [[Robert Bakker]], have speculated that the plates may have been mobile to some degree, although others disagree.<ref name="Buff86">{{cite journal|author=Buffrénil|year=1986|title=Growth and Function of ''Stegosaurus'' Plates|journal=Paleobiology|volume=12|pages=459–73}}</ref> Bakker suggested the plates were the bony cores of pointed horn-covered plates that a ''Stegosaurus'' could flip from one side to another to present a predator with an array of spikes and blades that would impede it from closing sufficiently to attack the ''Stegosaurus'' effectively. The plates would naturally sag to the sides of the ''Stegosaurus'', the length of the plates reflecting the width of the animal at that point along its spine. His reasoning for these plates to be covered in horn is that the surface fossilized plates have a resemblance to the bony cores of horns in other animals known or thought to bear horns, and his reasoning for the plates to be defensive in nature is that the plates had insufficient width for them to stand erect easily in such a manner as to be useful in display without continuous muscular effort.<ref name="bakker86c">{{cite book|author=Bakker, R |year=1986 |title=The Dinosaur Heresies |pages=229–34 |publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=0-14-015792-1}}</ref> ''S. stenops'' also had disk-shaped plates, on its hips.

=== Thagomizer (tail spikes) ===
{{Main|Thagomizer}}
[[File:Thagomizer 01.jpg|thumb|right|Thagomizer on mounted tail]]
Debate has been going on about whether the tail spikes were used for display only, as posited by Gilmore in 1914<ref name="gilmore14" /> or used as a weapon. Robert Bakker noted the tail was likely to have been much more flexible than that of other dinosaurs, as it lacked ossified tendons, thus lending credence to the idea of the tail as a weapon. However, as Carpenter<ref name="Carpenter98" /> has noted, the plates overlap so many tail vertebrae, movement would be limited. Bakker also observed that ''Stegosaurus'' could have maneuvered its rear easily, by keeping its large hind limbs stationary and pushing off with its very powerfully muscled but short fore limbs, allowing it to swivel deftly to deal with attack.<ref name="bakker86" /> More recently, a study of tail spikes by McWhinney ''et al.'',<ref>{{cite book|title=The Armored Dinosaurs|year=2001|chapter=Posttraumatic Chronic [[Osteomyelitis]] in ''Stegosaurus'' dermal spikes|editor=Carpenter, Kenneth|vauthors=McWhinney LA, Rothschild BM, Carpenter K |pages=141–56|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-33964-2}}</ref> which showed a high incidence of trauma-related damage, lends more weight to the position that the spikes were indeed used in combat. This study showed that 9.8% of ''Stegosaurus'' specimens examined had injuries to their tail spikes. Additional support for this idea was a punctured tail vertebra of an ''Allosaurus'' into which a tail spike fits perfectly.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Carnivorous Dinosaurs|year=2005|chapter=Evidence for predator-prey relationships: Examples for ''Allosaurus'' and ''Stegosaurus''.|editor=Carpenter, Kenneth|vauthors=Carpenter K, Sanders F, McWhinney L, Wood L |pages=325–50|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-34539-1}}</ref>

''S. stenops'' had four dermal spikes, each about {{convert|60|–|90|cm|ft|abbr=on}} long. Discoveries of articulated stegosaur armor show, at least in some species, these spikes protruded horizontally from the tail, not vertically as is often depicted.<ref name="Carpenter98" /> Initially, Marsh described ''S.&nbsp;ungulatus'' as having eight spikes in its tail, unlike ''S.&nbsp;stenops''. However, recent research re-examined this and concluded this species also had four.<ref name="8spike" />

=== "Second brain" ===
[[File:Stegosaurus brain.jpg|thumb|Brain cavity of ''S.&nbsp;stenops'' marked with red]]
Soon after describing ''Stegosaurus'', Marsh noted a large canal in the hip region of the spinal cord, which could have accommodated a structure up to 20 times larger than the famously small brain. This has led to the influential idea that dinosaurs like ''Stegosaurus'' had a "second brain" in the tail, which may have been responsible for controlling reflexes in the rear portion of the body. This "brain" might have given a ''Stegosaurus'' a temporary boost when it was under threat from predators.<ref name="FasWeis04" /> More recently discussed, this space (also found in [[sauropod]]s) may have been the location of a [[glycogen body]], a structure in living birds whose function is not definitely known, but which is postulated to facilitate the supply of [[glycogen]] to the animal's [[nervous system]].<ref name="Giffin90">{{cite journal|author=Buchholz (née Giffin) EB|year=1990|title=Gross Spinal Anatomy and Limb Use in Living and Fossil Reptiles|journal=Paleobiology|volume=16|pages=448–58}}</ref>

=== Diet ===
''Stegosaurus'' and related genera were herbivores. However, their teeth and jaws are very different from those of other herbivorous [[ornithischian]] dinosaurs, suggesting a different feeding strategy that is not yet well understood. The other ornithischians possessed teeth capable of grinding plant material and a jaw structure capable of movements in planes other than simply orthal (i.e. not only the fused up-down motion to which stegosaur jaws were likely limited). Unlike the sturdy jaws and grinding teeth common to its fellow ornithischians, ''Stegosaurus'' (and all stegosaurians) had small, peg-shaped teeth that have been observed with horizontal wear facets associated with tooth-food contact<ref>{{cite book|title=The Armored Dinosaurs|year=2001|chapter=Tooth wear and possible jaw action of ''Scelidosaurus harrisoni'', and a review of feeding mechanisms in other thyreophoran dinosaurs|editor=Carpenter, Kenneth|author=Barrett PM|pages=25–52|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-33964-2}}</ref> and their unusual jaws were probably capable of only orthal (up-down) movements.<ref name="dinosauria04" /> Their teeth were "not tightly pressed together in a block for efficient grinding",<ref name="conciseHistory">{{cite book | title=Dinosaurs: A Concise Natural History | publisher=Cambridge University Press |author1=Fastovsky, David E.  |author2=Weishampel, David B.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2009 | location=Cambridge, GBR | pages=89–90 | isbn=978-0-511-47789-8}}</ref> and no evidence in the fossil record of stegosaurians indicates use of [[gastrolith]]s—the stone(s) some dinosaurs (and some present-day bird species) ingested—to aid the grinding process, so how exactly ''Stegosaurus'' obtained and processed the amount of plant material required to sustain its size remains "poorly understood".<ref name="conciseHistory" />

The stegosaurians were widely distributed geographically in the late Jurassic.<ref name="dinosauria04" /> Palaeontologists believe it would have eaten plants such as mosses, ferns, horsetails, cycads, and conifers or fruits.<ref>[http://www.carnegiemnh.org/exhibits/jurassic/fctsteg.htm ''Stegosaurus ungulatus''] Carnegie Museum of Natural History.

One hypothesized feeding behavior strategy considers them to be low-level browsers, eating low-growing fruit of various nonflowering plants, as well as foliage. This scenario has ''Stegosaurus'' foraging at most 1&nbsp;m above the ground.<ref name="Weishampel84">{{cite journal|author=Weishampel DB|year=1984|title=Interactions between Mesozoic Plants and Vertebrates:Fructifications and seed predation|journal=N. Jb. Geol. Paläontol. Abhandl.|pages=224–50|volume=167}}</ref> Conversely, if ''Stegosaurus'' could have raised itself on two legs, as suggested by Bakker, then it could have browsed on vegetation and fruits quite high up, with adults being able to forage up to {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the ground.<ref name="FasWeis04" />

A detailed computer analysis of the biomechanics of ''Stegosaurus'''s feeding behavior was performed in 2010, using two different three-dimensional models of ''Stegosaurus'' teeth given realistic physics and properties. Bite force was also calculated using these models and the known skull proportions of the animal, as well as simulated tree branches of different size and hardness. The resultant bite forces calculated for ''Stegosaurus'' were 140.1 [[Newton (unit)|Newton]] (N), 183.7 N, and 275 N (for anterior, middle and posterior teeth, respectively), which means its bite force was less than half that of a [[Labrador Retriever]]. ''Stegosaurus'' could have easily bitten through smaller green branches, but would have had difficulty with anything over 12&nbsp;mm in diameter. ''Stegosaurus'', therefore, probably browsed primarily among smaller twigs and foliage, and would have been unable to handle larger plant parts unless the animal was capable of biting much more efficiently than predicted in this study.<ref>{{cite journal|doi= 10.1007/s00015-010-0025-1|title= A model for the bite mechanics in the herbivorous dinosaur Stegosaurus (Ornithischia, Stegosauridae)|year= 2010|last1= Reichel|first1= Miriam|journal= Swiss Journal of Geosciences|volume= 103|issue= 2|page= 235}}</ref> However, A study published on May 20, 2016 by Stephen Lautenschlager et al. indicates Stegosaurus' bite strength was stronger than previously believed. Comparisons were made between it (represented by a specimen known as "Sophie" from the United Kingdom's Natural History Museum) and two other herbivorous dinosaurs; ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'' and ''[[Plateosaurus]]'' to determine if all three had similar bite forces and similar niches. Based on the results of the study, it was revealed that ''Stegosaurus'' had a bite similar in strength to that of modern herbivorous mammals, in particular, cattle and sheep. Based on this data, it is likely ''Stegosaurus'' also ate woodier, tougher plants such as cycads, perhaps even acting as a means of spreading cycad seeds. The findings were published in the journal ''Scientific Reports''.<ref>http://www.techtimes.com/articles/160023/20160522/dinosaur-study-reveals-strength-of-stegosaurus-bite.htm</ref>

== Paleoecology ==
[[File:Stegosaurus dinosaur footprints in sandstone.jpg|thumb|Footprints of an adult and juvenile from the Morrison Formation]]
The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons, and flat floodplains. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of conifers, tree ferns, and ferns (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the [[Araucaria]]-like conifer ''[[Brachyphyllum]]''. The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, ferns, cycads, ginkoes, and several families of conifers. Animal fossils discovered include bivalves, snails, ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles like ''[[Dorsetochelys]]'', sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans like ''[[Hoplosuchus]]'', several species of [[pterosaur]]s such as ''[[Harpactognathus]]'' and ''[[Mesadactylus]]'', numerous dinosaur species, and early mammals such as [[Docodonta|docodonts]] (like ''[[Docodon]]''), [[Multituberculata|multituberculates]], [[Symmetrodonta|symmetrodonts]], and [[Eutriconodonta|triconodonts]].<ref>Chure, Daniel J.; Litwin, Ron; Hasiotis, Stephen T.; Evanoff, Emmett; and Carpenter, Kenneth (2006).

[[File:Dinosaurs Sci Am 1884.png|thumb|left|Early restoration of ''Stegosaurus'' by A. Tobin, 1884.]]
One of the most recognizable of all dinosaurs,<ref name="FasWeis04" /> ''Stegosaurus'' has been depicted on film, in cartoons and comics, as children's toys, and was even declared the [[List of U.S. state dinosaurs|State Dinosaur]] of Colorado in 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.gov/dpa/doit/archives/history/symbemb.htm |title=Colorado Department of Personnel website – State emblems |publisher=Colorado.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-03-11}}</ref> Due to the fragmentary nature of most early ''Stegosaurus'' fossil finds, it took many years before reasonably accurate restorations of these animals could be produced. The earliest popular image of ''Stegosaurus'' was an engraving produced by A. Tobin for the November 1884 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'', which included the dinosaur amid a speculative Morrison age landscape. Tobin restored the ''Stegosaurus'' as bipedal and long-necked, with the plates arranged along the tail and the back covered in spikes. This covering of spikes might have been based on a misinterpretation of the teeth, which Marsh had noted were oddly shaped, cylindrical, and found scattered, such that he thought they might turn out to be small dermal spines.<ref name=prehistoric_monsters>Debus, A. A. (2009). ''Prehistoric Monsters: The Real and Imagined Creatures of the Past That We Love to Fear''. McFarland.</ref>

Marsh published his more accurate skeletal reconstruction of ''Stegosaurus'' in 1891, and within a decade ''Stegosaurus'' had become among the most-illustrated types of dinosaur.<ref name=prehistoric_monsters/> Artist [[Charles R. Knight]] published his first illustration of ''Stegosaurus ungulatus'' based on Marsh's skeletal reconstruction in a November 1897 issue of ''[[Century Magazine]]''. This illustration would later go on to form the basis of the stop-motion puppet used in the 1933 film ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]''.<ref name=dinosaurs_decade/> Like Marsh's reconstruction, Knight's first restoration had a single row of large plates, though he next used a double row for his more well-known 1901 painting, produced under the direction of Frederic Lucas. Again under Lucas, Knight revised his version of ''Stegosaurus'' again two years later, producing a model with a staggered double row of plates. Knight would go on to paint a stegosaur with a staggered double plate row in 1927 for the [[Field Museum of Natural History]], and was followed by [[Rudolph F. Zallinger]], who painted ''Stegosaurus'' this way in his "Age of Reptiles" mural at the Peabody Museum in 1947.<ref name=dinosaurs_decade>Moore, R. (2014).

''Stegosaurus'' made its major public debut as a papier mache model commissioned by the U.S. [[National Museum of Natural History]] for the 1904 [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]]. The model was based on Knight's latest miniature with the double row of staggered plates,<ref name=gilmore1919/> and was exhibited in the United States Government Building at the exposition in [[St. Louis]] before being relocated to [[Portland, Oregon]] for the [[Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition]] in 1905. The model was moved to the [[Smithsonian]] National Museum of Natural History (now the [[Arts and Industries Building]]) in [[Washington, D.C.]] along with other prehistory displays, and to the current National Museum of Natural History building in 1911. Following renovations to the museum in the 2010s, the model was moved once again for display at the [[Museum of the Earth]] in [[Ithaca, New York]].<ref name=stegosaurus_model>[http://nmnh.typepad.com/smithsonian_fossils/2014/06/a-stegosaurus-built-to-last.html A Stegosaurus Built to Last].

The popularity of ''Stegosaurus'' is owed partly to its prominent display in natural history museums. Though considered one of the most distinctive types of dinosaur, ''Stegosaurus'' displays were missing from a majority of museums during the first half of the 20th century, due largely to the disarticulated nature of most fossil specimens.<ref name=gilmore1919/> Until 1918, the only mounted skeleton of ''Stegosaurus'' in the world was O.C. Marsh's type specimen of ''S. ungulatus'' at the [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]], which was put on display in 1910. However, this mount was dismantled in 1917 when the old Peabody Museum building was demolished.<ref name=gilmore1919>Gilmore, C.W. (1919). A newly mounted skeleton of the armored dinosaur, ''Stegosaurus stenops'', in the United States National Museum. ''Proceedings of the United States National Museum'', '''54''': 383-390.</ref> This historically significant specimen was re-mounted ahead of the opening of the new Peabody Museum building in 1925.<ref name=revan2011/> 1918 saw the completion of the second ''Stegosaurus'' mount, and the first depicting ''S. stenops''. This mount was created under the direction of Charles Gilmore at the U.S. National Museum of Natural History. It was a composite of several skeletons, primarily USNM 6531, with proportions designed to closely follow the ''S. stenops'' type specimen, which had been on display in relief nearby since 1918.<ref name=gilmore1919/> The aging mount was dismantled in 2003 and replaced with a cast in an updated pose in 2004.<ref name=extinct_monsters_marshdino2>Miller, B.

Accessed online 27-Dec-2015, http://extinctmonsters.net/2012/09/23/extinct-monsters-the-marsh-dinosaurs-part-ii/</ref> A third mounted skeleton of ''Stegosaurus'', referred to ''S. stenops'', was put on display at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in 1932. Mounted under the direction of Charles J. Long, the American Museum mount was a composite consisting of partial remains filled in with replicas based on other specimens. In his article about the new mount for the museum's journal, [[Barnum Brown]] described (and disputed) the popular misconception that the ''Stegosaurus'' had a "second brain" in its hips.<ref name=spine_armored_saurian>Brown, B.

''Natural History'', '''32''': 493-496.</ref> Another composite mount, using specimens referred to ''S. ungulatus'' collected from [[Dinosaur National Monument]] between 1920 and 1922, was put on display at the [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]] in 1940.<ref name=carnegie_dinosaur>McGinnis, H.J.
