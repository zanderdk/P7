The '''Muhammad al-Durrah incident''' took place in the [[Gaza Strip]] on 30 September 2000, on the second day of the [[Second Intifada]], during widespread rioting throughout the [[Palestinian territories]]. Jamal al-Durrah and his 12-year-old son, Muhammad, were filmed by Talal Abu Rahma, a Palestinian cameraman freelancing for [[France 2]], as they were caught in crossfire between Israeli and Palestinian security forces. The footage shows the pair crouching behind a concrete cylinder, the boy crying and the father waving, then a burst of gunfire and dust, after which the boy is seen slumped across his father's legs.<ref name=Haaretz16May2007>[http://www.haaretz.com/news/french-court-examines-footage-of-mohammad-al-dura-s-death-1.233240 "French court examines footage of Mohammad al-Dura's death"], ''Haaretz'', 16 May 2007.</ref>

Fifty-nine seconds of the footage were broadcast in France with a voiceover from [[Charles Enderlin]], the station's bureau chief in Israel, who was not present during the shooting. Based on information from the cameraman, Enderlin told viewers that the al-Durrahs had been the "target of fire from the Israeli positions" and that the boy had died.<ref name=EnderlinJan2005/><ref name=Moutet2008>Anne-Elisabeth Moutet, [http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/015/284xawsb.asp?pg=1 "L'Affaire Enderlin"], ''The Weekly Standard'', 7 July 2008.</ref> After an emotional public funeral, Muhammad was hailed throughout the Muslim world as a [[shahid|martyr]].<ref name=Cook2007pp155-156>David Cook, ''Martyrdom in Islam'', Cambridge University Press, 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KgVlKiXzodcC&pg=PA155 155–156].</ref>

==Background==
{{further information|Second Intifada}}
[[File:Temple Mount view 1.jpg|left|thumb|[[Temple Mount]]]]
On 28 September 2000, two days before the shooting, the Israeli opposition leader [[Ariel Sharon]] visited the [[Temple Mount]] in the [[Old City of Jerusalem]], a holy site in both Judaism and Islam with contested rules of access. The violence that followed had its roots in several events, but the visit was provocative and triggered protests that escalated into rioting across the [[West Bank]] and Gaza Strip.<ref name=Beckerman3Oct2007>Gal Beckerman, [http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/the_unpeaceful_rest_of_mohamme.php?page=all "The Unpeaceful Rest of Mohammed Al-Dura"], ''Columbia Journalism Review'', 3 October 2007.</ref><ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E4DA1E3AF93BA1575AC0A9669C8B63 "Palestinians And Israelis In a Clash At Holy Site"], ''The New York Times'', 28 September 2000.</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/949760.stm "Violence engulfs West Bank and Gaza"], BBC News, 30 September 2000.</ref>{{refn|group=n|The May 2001 [[Mitchell Report (Arab–Israeli conflict)|Mitchell Report]] into what caused the violence concluded: "[W]e have no basis on which to conclude that there was a deliberate plan by the PA [Palestinian Authority] to initiate a campaign of violence at the first opportunity; or to conclude that there was a deliberate plan by the GOI [Government of Israel] to respond with lethal force.&nbsp;...

The [[Netzarim]] junction, where the shooting took place, is known locally as the ''al-Shohada'' (martyrs') junction. It lies on Saladin Road, a few kilometres south of [[Gaza City]]. The source of conflict at the junction was the nearby Netzarim settlement, where 60 Israeli families lived until Israel's [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|withdrawal from Gaza in 2005]]. A military escort accompanied the settlers whenever they left or arrived at the settlement,<ref name=CNN27Sept2000/> and an Israeli military outpost, Magen-3, guarded the approach. The area had been the scene of violent incidents in the days before the shooting.<ref name=CNN27Sept2000>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060523071205/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/meast/09/27/israel.attack.ap/index.html "Israeli settler convoy bombed in Gaza, three injured"], CNN, 27 September 2000.</ref><ref name=Goldenberg3Oct2000>Suzanne Goldenberg, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2000/oct/03/israel6 "Making of a martyr"], ''The Guardian'', 3 October 2000.</ref>

===Jamal and Muhammad al-Durrah===
[[File:Netzarim junction map.png|thumb|Netzarim junction and the nearby [[Bureij (camp)|Bureij]] refugee camp and [[Netzarim]] settlement]]
Jamal al-Durrah (born c. 1963) was a carpenter and house painter before the shooting.<ref name=ScharyMotro2000/> Since then, because of his injuries, he has worked as a truck driver.<ref name=Shams2May2012>Doha Shams, [http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/6908/ "Still Seeking Justice for Muhammad al-Durrah"], ''Al-Akhbar'', 2 May 2012.</ref> He and his wife, Amal, live in the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East|UNRWA]]-run [[Bureij (camp)|Bureij refugee camp]] in the Gaza Strip.

Until the shooting, Jamal had worked for Moshe Tamam, an Israeli contractor, for 20 years, since he was 14. Writer Helen Schary Motro came to know Jamal when she employed him to help build her house in Tel Aviv. She described his years of rising at 3:30&nbsp;am to catch the bus to the border crossing at four, then a second bus out of Gaza so he could be at work by six. Tamam called him a "terrific man," someone he trusted to work alone in his customers' homes.<ref name=ScharyMotro2000>Helen Schary Motro, [http://www.salon.com/2000/10/07/jamal_2/ "Living among the headlines"], ''Salon'', 7 October 2000.</ref>

On the day of the shooting—[[Rosh Hashanah]], the Jewish New Year—the two-story [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) outpost at the Netzarim junction was manned by Israeli soldiers from the [[Givati Brigade]] Engineering Platoon and the [[IDF Sword Battalion|Herev Battalion]].<ref name=Gross21April2003>Netty C.

In an affidavit three days after the shooting, Abu Rahma said shots had been fired for about 45&nbsp;minutes and that he had filmed around 27&nbsp;minutes of it.{{refn|group=n|Talal Abu Rahma, 3 October 2000: "I spent approximately 27 minutes photographing the incident which took place for 45 minutes.&nbsp;... Shooting started first from different sources, Israeli and Palestinian. It lasted for not more than 5 minutes. Then, it was quite clear for me that shooting was towards the child Mohammed and his father from the opposite direction to them. Intensive and intermittent shooting was directed at the two and the two outposts of the Palestinian National Security Forces. The Palestinian outposts were not a source of shooting, as shooting from inside these outposts had stopped after the first five minutes, and the child and his father were not injured then. Injuring and killing took place during the following 45 minutes."<ref name=AbuRahma3Oct2000/>}} (How much film was shot became a bone of contention in 2007 when France&nbsp;2 [[#2007: ''Karsenty v.

The footage shows Jamal and Muhammad crouching behind the cylinder, the child screaming and the father shielding him. Jamal appears to shout something in the direction of the cameraman, then waves and shouts in the direction of the Israeli outpost. There is a burst of gunfire and the camera goes out of focus.

===Cameraman's account===
Enderlin based his allegation that the IDF had shot the boy on the report of the cameraman, Talal Abu Rahma.<ref name=EnderlinJan2005>{{fr icon}} Charles Enderlin, "Non à la censure à la source," ''Le Figaro'', 27 January 2005 ([http://www.debriefing.org/21078.html courtesy link]).</ref> Abu Rahma was clear in interviews that the Israelis had fired the shots. For example, he told ''The Guardian'': "They were cleaning the area. Of course they saw the father. They were aiming at the boy, and that is what surprised me, yes, because they were shooting at him, not only one time, but many times."<ref name=Goldenberg3Oct2000/> Abu Rahma said shooting was also coming from the Palestinian National Security Forces outpost, but that they were not shooting when Muhammad was hit. The Israeli fire was being directed at this Palestinian outpost, he said.<ref name=AbuRahma3Oct2000/> He told National Public Radio:

<blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:5em; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 3px #ccc; padding:1.5em;">
I saw the boy getting injured in his leg, and the father asking for help. Then I saw him getting injured in his arm, the father. The father was asking the ambulances to help him, because he could see the ambulances. I cannot see the ambulance&nbsp;... I wasn't far away, maybe from them [Jamal and Muhammad] face to face about 15 meters, 17 meters. But the father didn't succeed to get the ambulance by waving to them. He looked at me and he said, "Help me." I said, "I cannot, I can't help you." The shooting till then was really heavy&nbsp;...

===Israel's early response===
[[File:Isaac Herzog 2004.JPG|thumb|upright=0.80|[[Isaac Herzog]]]]
The position of the IDF changed over time, from accepting responsibility in 2000 to retracting the admission in 2005.<ref name=Seaman2008>[[Daniel Seaman]], [http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=105522 "We did not abandon Philippe Karsenty"], ''The Jerusalem Post'', 25 June 2008.</ref> The IDF's first response, when Enderlin contacted them before his broadcast, was that the Palestinians "make cynical use of women and children," which he decided not to air.<ref name=Schwartz8Nov2007/>

On 3 October 2000, the IDF's chief of operations, Major-General [[Giora Eiland]], said an internal investigation indicated the shots had apparently been fired by Israeli soldiers.<ref name=BBC3Oct2000/> The soldiers, under fire, had been shooting from small slits in the wall of their outpost; General Yom-Tov Samia, then head of the IDF's Southern Command said they may not have had a clear field of vision, and had fired in the direction from which they believed the fire was coming.<ref name=Fallows2003/> Eiland issued an apology: "This was a grave incident, an event we are all sorry about."<ref name=BBC3Oct2000/>

The Israelis had been trying for hours to speak to Palestinian commanders, according to Israel's Cabinet Secretary, [[Isaac Herzog]]; he added that Palestinian security forces could have intervened to stop the fire.<ref name=BBC2Oct2000>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/952600.stm "Boy becomes Palestinian martyr"], BBC News, 2 October 2000.</ref>

==Controversy==

===Overview===
[[File:Arlette Chabot, April 2009 (cropped).jpeg|thumb|left|France&nbsp;2 news editor, [[Arlette Chabot]], said that no one could say for certain who fired the shots.<ref name=Carvajal7Feb2005/>]]
Three mainstream narratives emerged after the shooting. The early view that Israeli gunfire had killed the boy developed into the position that, because of the trajectory of the shots, Palestinian gunfire was more likely to have been responsible. This view was expressed in 2005 by [[Denis Jeambar]], editor-in-chief of ''L'Express'', and [[:fr:Daniel Leconte|Daniel Leconte]], a former France&nbsp;2 correspondent, who viewed the raw footage.<ref name=Jeambar25Jan2005/> A third perspective, held by [[Arlette Chabot]], France 2's news editor, is that no one can know who fired the shots.<ref name=Carvajal7Feb2005/>

A fourth, minority, position held that the scene was staged by Palestinian protesters to produce a child martyr or at least the appearance of one.<ref name=Carvajal7Feb2005/><ref name=Gelernter/><ref>[[David Frum]], [http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=877a8d56-eda5-4b86-96c6-9e1ab9a07880 "L'affaire al-Dura"], ''The National Post'', 17 November 2007.</ref> This is known by those who follow the case as the "maximalist" view, as opposed to the "minimalist" view that the shots were probably not fired by the IDF.<ref name=Fallows2003/><ref name=Johnson2012pp126-127/> The maximalist view takes the form either that the al-Durrahs were not shot and Muhammad did not die, or that he was killed intentionally by Palestinians.<ref name=Fallows2003/><ref name=Orme28Nov2000>William A.

===Key issues===
Key issues include [[#length of footage|how much footage was shot]]; that it was blurred at the moment Jamal and Muhammad were hit; that France&nbsp;2 cut a few seconds in which the boy moves; and that the cameraman [[#break in footage|stopped filming]] at that point. Despite the presence of camera crews from (at least) France 2, Associated Press and Reuters, there is no footage of the c.&nbsp;17&nbsp;minutes Jamal and Muhammad waited for an ambulance or of them being loaded into one.<ref>For Abu Rahma discussing the 17 minutes, see [https://vimeo.com/67054759 Schapira and Hafner 2009], from 00:12:53:00.</ref> There is no film of the death of the first ambulance driver, Bassam al-Bilbeisi, who was reportedly shot on his way to pick them up.

Several commentators questioned [[#timeline|what time]] the shooting occurred; what time Muhammad arrived at the hospital; why there seemed to be little blood on the ground where they were shot; and whether any bullets were collected.<ref name=Fallows2003/> Several alleged that, in other scenes in the raw footage, it is clear that protesters are play acting.<ref name=Fallows2003/> [[#father's injuries|One physician maintained]] that Jamal's scars were not from bullet wounds, but dated back to an injury he sustained in the early 1990s.<ref name=Shams2May2012/>

There was no criminal inquiry.<ref name=Segev2002>Tom Segev, [http://www.haaretz.com/who-killed-mohammed-al-dura-1.49741 "Who killed Mohammed al-Dura?"], ''Haaretz'', 22 March 2002.</ref> Palestinian police allowed journalists to photograph the scene the following day, but they gathered no forensic evidence. According to a Palestinian general, there was no Palestinian investigation because there was no doubt that the Israelis had killed the boy.<ref>[https://vimeo.com/67662480 Schapira 2002], 00:29:52:00.</ref> General [[Yom Tov Samia]] of the IDF said the presence of protesters meant the Israelis were unable to examine and take photographs of the scene.<ref>[https://vimeo.com/67662480 Schapira 2002], 00:29:42:00.</ref> The increase in violence at the junction cut off the Nezarim settlers, so the IDF evacuated them and, a week after the shooting, blew up everything within 500 metres of the IDF outpost, thereby destroying the crime scene.<ref>[https://vimeo.com/67662480 Schapira 2002], 00:33:14:00.</ref>

A pathologist examined the boy's body, but there was no full autopsy.<ref name=Segev2002/><ref name="Schapira 2002 24:17"/> It is unclear whether bullets were recovered from the scene or from Jamal and Muhammad.<ref name=Segev2002/> In 2002 Abu Rahma implied to Esther Schapira that he had collected bullets at the scene, adding: "We have some secrets for ourselves. We cannot give anything&nbsp;... everything."<ref>[https://vimeo.com/67662480 Schapira 2002], 00:30:44:00.</ref> According to Jamal al-Durrah, five bullets were recovered from his body by physicians in Gaza and four in Amman.<ref name="Schapira 2002 00:26:49:00"/> In 2013 he said, without elaborating: "The bullets the Israelis fired are in the possession of the Palestinian Authority."<ref name=Koury29May2013/>

===Footage===

====How long, what it showed{{anchor|length of footage}}====
Questions arose about how much footage existed and whether it showed the boy had died. Abu Rahma said in an affidavit that the gunfight had lasted 45&nbsp;minutes and that he had filmed about 27&nbsp;minutes of it.<ref name=AbuRahma3Oct2000/><ref name=Schwartz3Feb2008/> Doreen Carvajal of the ''International Herald Tribune'' said in 2005 that France&nbsp;2 had shown the newspaper "the original 27-minute tape of the incident."{{refn|group=n|"As questions were raised, some France&nbsp;2 executives privately faulted the channel's communication. Last week, they showed ''The International Herald Tribune'' the original 27-minute tape of the incident, which also included separate scenes of rock-throwing youths."<ref name=Carvajal7Feb2005/>}} When the Court of Appeal of Paris asked, in 2007, to see all the footage, during France&nbsp;2's libel case against Philippe Karsenty, France&nbsp;2 presented the court with 18&nbsp;minutes of film, saying the rest had been destroyed because it had not been about the shooting.<ref>{{fr icon}} "La justice visionne les rushes d'un reportage de France&nbsp;2, accusé de trucage," Agence France-Presse, 14 November 2007.</ref> Enderlin then said only 18&nbsp;minutes of footage had been shot.<ref name=Schoumann2007/>

According to Abu Rahma, six minutes of his footage focused on the al-Durrahs.<ref name="Schapira 2009, 00:10:39:24"/> France&nbsp;2 broadcast 59&nbsp;seconds of that scene and released another few seconds of it. No part of the footage shows the boy dead.<ref name=Schwartz8Nov2007/> Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the end, during which Muhammad appears to lift his hand away from his face.<ref name=Fallows2003/><ref name=finalfootage>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75hiDGp89Xk Final moments of footage], France&nbsp;2, 30 September 2000, courtesy of YouTube.</ref> Enderlin said he had cut this scene in accordance with the France&nbsp;2 ethical charter, because it showed the boy in his death throes ("''agonie''"), which he said was "unbearable" ("''J'ai coupé l'agonie de l'enfant. C'était insupportable&nbsp;... Cela n'aurait rien apporté de plus'').<ref name=Jeambar25Jan2005/>{{refn|group=n|Charles Enderlin, ''The Atlantic'', September 2003: "James Fallows writes, 'The footage of the shooting&nbsp;... illustrates the way in which television transforms reality' and, notably, 'France&nbsp;2 or its cameraman may have footage that it or he has chosen not to release.' We do not transform reality. But since some parts of the scene are unbearable, France&nbsp;2 cut a few seconds from the scene, in accordance with our ethical charter."<ref name=EnderlinSept2003>Charles Enderlin, [http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/09/letters-to-the-editor/376863/ "Letters to the Editor: Who Shot Mohammed al-Dura?"], ''The Atlantic'', September 2003.</ref>}}<ref name=Johnson2012pp126-127>Hannah Johnson, ''Blood Libel: The Ritual Murder Accusation at the Limit of Jewish History'', University of Michigan Press, 2012, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ri0tiLVQU4kC&pg=PA126 126–127].</ref> In 2007 he said he had meant to use the word ''agony'', not ''agonie''.

He replied that he would say the same things, but that in the editing process he would include footage of the 'child's agony,' raising a question once again about his previous claims. During the first edit, Enderlin said, the video in question was 'cut considerably at the time because it made the report too hard.'"<ref name=Cahen15Feb2005/>}}

====Why the footage stopped when it did{{anchor|break in footage}}====
Another issue is why France&nbsp;2, the Associated Press and Reuters did not film the scene directly after the shooting, including the shooting death of the ambulance driver who arrived to pick up Jamal and Muhammad.

Abu Rahma said Muhammad lay bleeding for at least 17&nbsp;minutes before an ambulance picked up Jamal and Muhammad together,<ref name="Schapira 2009 00:14:13:21"/> but he did not film any of it.

====French journalists view the footage====
[[File:Denis Jeambar 2010 a.jpg|thumb|[[Denis Jeambar]]]]
In October 2004 France 2 allowed three French journalists to view the raw footage—[[Denis Jeambar]], editor-in-chief of ''L'Express''; [[:fr:Daniel Leconte|Daniel Leconte]], former France 2 correspondent and head of news documentaries at Arte, a state-run television network; and [[:fr:Luc Rosenzweig|Luc Rosenzweig]], former editor-in-chief of ''Le Monde''.<ref name=Moutet2008/> They also asked to speak to the cameraman, who was in Paris at the time, but France 2 apparently told them he did not speak French and that his English was not good enough.<ref name=Poller2005>Nidra Poller, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080618220310/http://www.commentarymagazine.com/printArticle.cfm/Myth--Fact--and-the-al-Dura-Affair-9935 "Myth, Fact, and the al-Dura Affair"], ''Commentary'', September 2005.</ref>

Jeambar and Leconte wrote a report about the viewing for ''Le Figaro'' in January 2005. None of the scenes showed that the boy had died, they wrote. They rejected the position that the scene had been staged, but when Enderlin's voiceover said Muhammad was dead, Enderlin "had no possibility of determining that he was in fact dead, and even less so, that he had been shot by IDF soldiers." They said the footage did not show the boy's death throes: "This famous 'agonie' that Enderlin insisted was cut from the montage does not exist."<ref name=Carvajal7Feb2005/><ref name=Jeambar25Jan2005>{{fr icon}} [[Denis Jeambar]] and Daniel Leconte, [http://www.lefigaro.fr/debats/2006/10/19/01005-20061019ARTWWW90323-guet_apens_dans_la_guerre_des_images.php "Guet-apens dans la guerre des images"], ''Le Figaro'', 25 January 2005.</ref>

Several minutes of the film showed Palestinians playing at war for the cameras, they wrote, falling down as if wounded, then getting up and walking away.<ref name=Jeambar25Jan2005/> A France&nbsp;2 official told them, "You know it's always like that," a comment that Leconte said he found disturbing given the controversy. Christine Delavennat, France 2's communications director, said that none of the scenes in the footage had been staged.<ref name=Cahen15Feb2005/> Jeambar and Leconte concluded that the shots had come from the Palestinian positions, given the trajectory of the bullets.<ref name=Jeambar25Jan2005/> Leconte said in an interview: "If they had been Israeli bullets, they would be very strange bullets because they would have needed to go around the corner." He dismissed France&nbsp;2's explanation—that perhaps the bullets that hit the boy had ricocheted off the ground. "It could happen once, but that there should be eight or nine of them, which go around a corner? They're just saying anything."<ref name=Cahen15Feb2005/>

The idea of writing about the raw footage had been Luc Rosenzweig's; he had initially offered a story about it to  ''L'Express'', which is how Jeambar (editor of ''L'Express'') had become involved.<ref name=Poller2005/> But Jeambar and Leconte ended up distancing themselves from Rosenzweig. He was involved with the Israeli-French Metula News Agency (known as Mena), which was pushing the view that the scene was a fake.<ref name=Carvajal7Feb2005/><ref name=Jeambar25Jan2005/> Rosenzweig later called it "an almost perfect media crime."<ref name=Gelernter>[[David Gelernter]], "When pictures lie," ''Los Angeles Times'', 9 September 2005 ([http://www.jewishworldreview.com/david/gelernter091205.php3 courtesy link]).</ref> When Jeambar and Leconte wrote up their report about the raw footage, they initially offered it ''Le Monde'', not ''Le Figaro'', but ''Le Monde'' refused to publish it because Mena had been involved at an earlier stage. Jeambar and Leconte made clear in ''Le Figaro'' that they gave no credence to the staging hypothesis:

<blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:5em; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 3px #ccc; padding:1.5em;">
To those who, like Mena, tried to use us to support the theory that the child's death was staged by the Palestinians, we say they are misleading us and their readers. Not only do we not share that point of view, but we attest that, given our present knowledge of the case, nothing supports that conclusion. In fact, the reverse is true."{{refn|group=n|[[Denis Jeambar]] and Daniel Leconte, ''Le Figaro'', January 2005: "''A ceux qui, comme la Mena, ont voulu nous instrumentaliser pour étayer la thèse de la mise en scène de la mort de l'enfant par des Palestiniens, nous disons qu'ils nous trompent et qu'ils trompent leurs lecteurs. Non seulement nous ne partageons pas ce point de vue, mais nous affirmons qu'en l'état actuel de notre connaissance du dossier, rien ne permet de l'affirmer, bien au contraire.''"<ref name=Jeambar25Jan2005/>}}</blockquote>

====Enderlin's response====
Enderlin responded to Leconte and Jeambar in January 2005 in ''Le Figaro''. He thanked them for rejecting that the scene had been staged. He had reported that the shots were fired by the Israelis because, he wrote, he trusted the cameraman, who had worked for France 2 since 1988. In the days following the shooting, other witnesses, including other journalists, offered some confirmation, he said. He added that the Israeli army had not responded to France 2's offers to cooperate with their investigation.<ref name=EnderlinJan2005/>

Another reason he had attributed the shooting to Israel, he wrote, was that "the image corresponded to the reality of the situation not only in Gaza but also in the West Bank." Citing Ben Kaspi in the Israeli newspaper ''Maariv'', he wrote that, during the first months of the Second Intifada, the IDF had fired one million rounds of ammunition—700,000 in the West Bank and 300,000 in Gaza; from 29 September to late October 2000, 118 Palestinians had been killed, including 33 under the age of 18, compared to 11 adult Israelis killed during the same period.<ref name=EnderlinJan2005/>

===Confusion about timeline{{anchor|timeline}}===
Confusion arose about the timeline. The cameraman said the shooting began at noon and continued for 45 minutes.<ref name=AbuRahma3Oct2000/> Jamal's account matched his: he and Muhammad arrived at the junction around noon,<ref name="Schapira 2002 00:19:00:00"/> and were under fire for 45 minutes.<ref name=ScharyMotro2000/>

Enderlin's France&nbsp;2 report placed the shooting later in the day. His voiceover said that Jamal and Muhammad were shot around 3:00&nbsp;pm local time (GMT+3).<ref name=Enderlin30Sept2000/>{{refn|group=n|[[Israel Summer Time]], which ended that year on 6 October, is three hours ahead of GMT.<ref>{{he icon}} [http://www.nevo.co.il/Law_word/law14/LAW-1748.pdf ''Book of Laws: Time Determination Law - 2000 (5760)''], Israeli Government Printing Office, 1748, 28 July 2000, 249.</ref>}} James Fallows agreed that Jamal and Muhammad first made an appearance in the footage around 3:00&nbsp;pm, judging by comments from Jamal and some journalists on the scene.<ref name=Fallows2003/> Abu Rahma said he remained at the junction for 30–40 minutes after the shooting.<ref name=AbuRahma3Oct2000/> According to Schapira, he left for his studio in Gaza at around 4 pm, where he sent the footage to Enderlin in Jerusalem at around 6 pm. The news first arrived in London from the Associated Press at 6:00 pm BST (GMT+1), followed minutes later by a similar report from Reuters.<ref>[[Brian Whitaker]], [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2000/oct/05/israel6 "War of words in the Middle East"], ''The Guardian'', 5 October 5, 2000. (At that point, the AP and Reuters were calling Muhammad "Rami Aldura" by mistake.)</ref>

Contradicting the noon and 3&nbsp;pm timelines, Mohammed Tawil, the doctor who admitted Muhammad to the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, told Esther Schapira that the boy had been admitted around 10:00&nbsp;am local time, along with the ambulance driver, who had been shot through the heart.<ref>[https://vimeo.com/67054759 Schapira and Hafner 2009], 00:38:22:11.</ref><ref>{{de icon}} Thomas Thiel, [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/fernsehen/im-gespraech-esther-schapira-was-geschah-mit-mohammed-al-dura-1922381.html?printPagedArticle=true#pageIndex_2 "Was geschah mit Mohammed al-Dura?"], ''Frankfurter Allgemeine'', 4 March 2009.</ref> Tawil later said that he could not recall what he had told reporters about this.<ref>{{fr icon}} [[Charles Enderlin]], ''Un Enfant est Mort: Netzarim, 30 Septembre 2000'', Paris: Don Quichotte, October 2010.<!--add page number--></ref> Records from the Al-Shifa Hospital reportedly show that a young boy was examined in the pathology department at midday. The pathologist, Dr.&nbsp;Abed El-Razeq El Masry, examined him for half an hour. He told Schapira that the boy's abdominal organs were lying outside his body, and he showed Schapira [[:File:Muhammad al-Durrah pathologist's image.JPG|images of the body]], with a card identifying the boy as Muhammad.<ref>[https://vimeo.com/67054759 Schapira and Hafner 2009], 00:39:28:01.</ref> A watch on a pathologist's wrist in one of the images appeared to say 3:50.<ref>[https://vimeo.com/67054759 Schapira and Hafner 2009], 00:40:39:22.</ref>

===Interview with soldiers===
In 2002 Schapira interviewed three anonymous Israeli soldiers, "Ariel, Alexej and Idan," who said they had been on duty at the IDF post that day.<ref>[https://vimeo.com/67662480 Schapira 2002], 00:03:59:00; 00:14:59:00 for the names.</ref> They knew something was about to happen, one said, because of the camera crews that had gathered.<ref>[https://vimeo.com/67662480 Schapira 2002], 00:05:00:00.</ref> One soldier said the live fire started from the high-rise Palestinian blocks known as "the twins"; the shooter was firing at the IDF post, he said.<ref>[https://vimeo.com/67662480 Schapira 2002], 00:15:50:00.</ref> The soldier added that he had not seen the al-Durrahs.<ref>[https://vimeo.com/67662480 Schapira 2002], 00:16:15:00.</ref> The Israelis returned fire on a Palestinian station 30 metres to the left of the al-Durrahs. Their weapons were equipped with optics that allowed them to fire accurately, according to the soldier, and none of them had switched to automatic fire.<ref>[https://vimeo.com/67662480 Schapira 2002], 00:16:48:00.</ref> In the view of the soldier, the shooting of Jamal and Muhammad was no accident. The shots did not come from the Israeli position, he said.<ref>[https://vimeo.com/67662480 Schapira 2002], 00:17:24:00</ref>

===Father's injuries{{anchor|father's injuries}}===
In 2007 Yehuda David, a physician at [[Sheba Medical Center|Tel Hashomer hospital]] near Tel Aviv, told Israel's Channel 10 that he had treated Jamal Al-Durrah in 1994 for knife and axe wounds to his arms and legs, injuries sustained during a gang attack. David maintained that the scars Jamal had presented as bullet wounds were in fact scars from a tendon-repair operation David had performed in the early 90s.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U03h2oEZd0 "Scars from the past"], Channel 10, 13 December 2007; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQna9EY6DFg Interview with Yehuda David], Channel 7 (Israel National News), 20 May 2012, courtesy of ''YouTube''.</ref> When David repeated his allegations in an interview with a "Daniel Vavinsky," published in 2008 in ''Actualité Juive'' in Paris, Jamal filed a complaint with the [[Tribunal de grande instance de Paris]] for defamation and breach of doctor-patient confidentiality.<ref name=Tribunal29April2011>{{fr icon}} [http://asset.rue89.com/files/Weil.20110429_151418-1.pdf "Ministere Public c/ Benattar, Weill, David"], ''Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris'', 29 April 2011.</ref>

The court established that "Daniel Vavinsky" was a pseudonym for [[:fr:Clément Weill-Raynal|Clément Weill-Raynal]], a deputy editor at [[France 3]].<ref name=Lherm21Feb2011>{{fr icon}} Sophie Lherm, [http://television.telerama.fr/television/quand-un-redac-chef-de-france-3-se-prend-pour-le-justicier-masque,65899.php "Affaire Al-Dura: quand un rédac'chef de France 3 se prend pour le justicier masqué"], Télérama, 21 February 2011.</ref> In 2011 it ruled that David and ''Actualité Juive'' had defamed Jamal.

In 2012 Rafi Walden, deputy director of the Tel Hashomer hospital and board member of [[Physicians for Human Rights]], wrote in ''Haaretz'' that he had examined Jamal's 50-page medical file, and that the injuries from the 2000 shooting were "completely different wounds" from the 1994 injuries. Walden listed "a gunshot wound in the right wrist, a shattered forearm bone, multiple fragment wounds in a palm, gunshot wounds in the right thigh, a fractured pelvis, an exit wound in the buttocks, a tear in the main nerve of the right thigh, tears in the main groin arteries and veins, and two gunshot wounds in the left lower leg."<ref name=Walden19Feb2012>Rafi Walden, [http://www.haaretz.com/rubbing-salt-into-the-wound-1.413383 "Rubbing Salt Into the Wound"], ''Haaretz'', 19 February 2012.</ref>

Major General [[Yom Tov Samia]], the IDF's southern commander, set up an inquiry soon after the shooting.<ref name=Cygielman7Nov2000>Anat Cygielman, "IDF keeps shooting itself in the foot," ''Haaretz'', 7 November 2000 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20021219063255/http://www.proche-orient.info/images/mbd/Anata_deux_Al_doura.htm courtesy link]).</ref> According to James Fallows, Israeli commentators questioned its legitimacy as soon as it started; ''Haaretz'' called it "almost a pirate endeavour."<ref name=Fallows2003/> The team was led by [[Nahum Shahaf]], a physicist, and Joseph Doriel, an engineer, both of whom had been involved in the [[Yitzhak Rabin assassination conspiracy theories]].<ref name=Cygielman7Nov2000/><ref>Ed O'Loughlin, [http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/battle-rages-over-fateful-footage/2007/10/05/1191091366434.html "Battle rages over fateful footage"], ''The Age'', 6 October 2007.</ref> Other investigators included Meir Danino, chief scientist at Elisra Systems; Bernie Schechter, a ballistics expert, formerly with the Israeli police's criminal identification laboratory; and Chief Superintendent Elliot Springer, also from the criminal identification lab.

Shahaf and Doriel built models of the wall, concrete drum and IDF post, and tried to reenact the shooting. A mark on the drum from the Israeli Bureau of Standards allowed them to determine its size and composition.

On 23 October 2000, Shahaf and Doriel invited CBS ''[[60 Minutes]]'' to film the reenactment. Doriel told the correspondent, [[Bob Simon]], that he believed the boy's death was real, but that it had been set up to damage Israel.

===2007: ''Karsenty v. Enderlin-France 2''===
The first appeal opened in September 2007 in the [[Court of Appeal of Paris]], before a three-judge panel led by Judge Laurence Trébucq.<ref name=Poller2008/> The court asked France&nbsp;2 to turn over the 27&nbsp;minutes of raw footage the cameraman said he had shot, to be shown during a public hearing. France&nbsp;2 produced 18&nbsp;minutes; Enderlin said that only 18 minutes had been shot.<ref name=Schoumann2007>Helen Schoumann, [http://web.archive.org/web/20080622192742/http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?c=JPArticle&cid=1195036613140&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull "French court sees raw footage of al-Dura"], ''The Jerusalem Post'', 14 November 14, 2007.</ref>

[[File:3919ParigiPalaisDeJustice.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.35|The appeal was heard in the [[Palais de Justice, Paris|Palais de Justice]].]]
During the screening, the court heard that Muhammad had raised his hand to his forehead and moved his leg after the cameraman had said he was dead, and that there was no blood on his shirt.<ref name=Schoumann2007 /> Enderlin argued that the cameraman had not said the boy was dead, but that he was dying.<ref name="Haaretz16May2007"/> A report prepared for the court by Jean-Claude Schlinger, a ballistics expert commissioned by Karsenty, said that had the shots come from the Israeli position, Muhammad would have been hit in the lower limbs only.<ref name=Schlinger2008>{{fr icon}} Jean-Claude Schlinger, [https://web.archive.org/web/20081112083110/http://www.m-r.fr/balistique.pdf "Ballistics report prepared for Karsenty"], 19 February 2008.</ref>{{rp|60}}<ref name=Schwartz3Feb2008>Adi Schwartz, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/independent-expert-idf-bullets-didn-t-kill-mohammed-al-dura-1.240438 "Independent expert: IDF bullets didn't kill Mohammed al-Dura"], ''Haaretz'', 3 February 2008.</ref>

France&nbsp;2's lawyer, [[:fr:Francis Szpiner|Francis Szpiner]], counsel to former President of France [[Jacques Chirac]], called Karsenty "the Jew who pays a second Jew to pay a third Jew to fight to the last drop of Israeli blood," comparing him to 9/11 conspiracy theorist [[Thierry Meyssan]] and Holocaust denier [[Robert Faurisson]]. Karsenty had it in for Enderlin, Szpiner argued, because of Enderlin's even-handed coverage of the Middle East.<ref name=Poller2008>Nidra Poller, [http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121183795208620963 "A Hoax?"], ''Wall Street Journal'', 27 May 2008.</ref>

The judges overturned the ruling against Karsenty in May 2008 in a 13-page decision.<ref>For a translation: [[:s:Karsenty v. Enderlin-France2]], Wikisource, 21 May 2008.</ref> They ruled that he had exercised in good faith his right to criticize and had shown the court a "coherent body of evidence."<ref name=Moutet2008/><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7415858.stm "French TV loses Gaza footage case"], BBC News, 22 May 2008.</ref> The court noted inconsistencies in Enderlin's statements and said that the cameraman's statements were not "perfectly credible either in form or content."<ref name=Moutet2008/><ref name=Poller2008/> There were calls for a public inquiry from historian [[Élie Barnavi]], a former Israeli ambassador to France, and Richard Prasquier, president of the ''[[Conseil Représentatif des Institutions juives de France]]''.<ref>{{fr icon}} [[Élie Barnavi]], "L'honneur du journalisme," ''Marianne'', 581, 7–13 June 2008.</ref><ref name=Prasquier2008>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081022210110/http://www.crif.org/?page=articles_display/detail&aid=11608&returnto=articles_display/list&artyd=2 "Prasquier: 'establishing the truth about the Al-Dura case'"], ''Conseil Représentatif des Institutions juives de France'', 19 July 2008.</ref><ref name=Lauter8July2008>Devorah Lauter, [http://www.jta.org/2008/07/08/news-opinion/world/french-jews-demand-al-dura-probe "French Jews demand al-Dura probe"], ''Jewish Telegraphic Agency'', 8 July 2008.</ref> The left-leaning ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'' began a petition in support of Enderlin that was signed by 300 French writers, accusing Karsenty of a seven-year smear campaign.<ref name=Moutet2008/>

===2013: Defamation ruling===
France&nbsp;2 appealed to the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] (supreme court). In February 2012 it quashed the decision of the appeal court to overturn the conviction,<ref name=Haaretz26June2013/> ruling that the court should not have asked France&nbsp;2 to provide the raw footage.<ref>[http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/02/29/197701.html "France high court ordered judges to examine Palestinian boy killing case"], Agence France-Presse, 29 February 2012.</ref><ref>{{fr icon}} [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Arr%C3%AAt_de_la_Cour_de_Cassation_A-Dura_France-2_Karsenty "Arrêté de la Cour de Cassation A-Dura Frane-2 Karsenty"], Wikisource.</ref> The case was sent back to the appeal court, which convicted Karsenty of defamation in 2013 and fined him €7,000.<ref name=AP26June2013/><ref name=Haaretz26June2013>[http://www.haaretz.com/world-news/.premium-1.532184 "French Media Analyst Convicted of Defamation, Fined in Mohammed al-Dura Case"], Associated Press and ''Haaretz'', 26 June 2013.</ref>

==Impact of the footage==
[[File:Avenue Al Qoods, Bamako, Mali, 2006.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Place de l'enfant martyr de Palestine, [[Bamako]], [[Mali]]]]
The footage of Muhammad was compared to other iconic images of children under attack: the [[:File:Stroop Report - Warsaw Ghetto Uprising 06b.jpg|boy in the Warsaw ghetto]] (1943), the [[:File:TrangBang.jpg|Vietnamese girl]] doused with napalm (1972), and the [[:File:Firefighterbabyocb.jpg|firefighter carrying the dying baby]] in Oklahoma (1995).<ref name=ScharyMotro2000/> [[:fr:Catherine Nay|Catherine Nay]], a French journalist, argued that Muhammad's death "cancels, erases that of the Jewish child, his hands in the air before the SS in the Warsaw Ghetto."<ref>{{fr icon}} Ivan Rioufol, [http://www.lefigaro.fr/debats/2008/06/10/01005-20080610ARTFIG00634-les-mediaspouvoir-intouchable.php "Les médias, pouvoir intouchable?"], ''Le Figaro'', 13 June 2008.</ref>

Palestinian children were distressed by the repeated broadcasting of the footage, according to a therapist in Gaza, and were re-enacting the scene in playgrounds.<ref>Bryan Pearson, "Death of Mohammed al-Durra haunts Palestinian children," Agence France-Presse, 6 November 2000.</ref> Arab countries issued postage stamps bearing the images. Parks and streets were named in Muhammad's honour, and [[Osama bin Laden]] mentioned him in a "warning" to President George Bush after 9/11.<ref name=Cordesman2005p371>Cordesman and Moravitz 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-dRUGqwLSE4C&pg=PA371 371].</ref> The images were blamed for the [[2000 Ramallah lynching]] and a rise in antisemitism in France.<ref name=Lauter8July2008/> One image could be seen in the background when journalist [[Daniel Pearl]], an American Jew, was beheaded by al-Qaeda in February 2002.<ref name=Fallows2003/>

Sections of the Jewish and Israeli communities, including the Israeli government in 2013, described the statements that IDF soldiers had killed the boy as a "blood libel," a reference to the [[blood libel|centuries-old allegation that Jews sacrifice Christian children for their blood]].<ref name=Johnson2012pp126-127/><ref name=Kuperwasserpressrelease2013/> Comparisons were made with the [[Dreyfus affair]] of 1894, when a French-Jewish army captain was found guilty of treason based on a forgery.<ref name=Taguieff2008>{{fr icon}} Pierre-André Taguieff, [https://web.archive.org/web/20081008235728/http://www.lemeilleurdesmondes.org/A_chaud_Pierre-Andre-Taguieff-affaire-al-Dura-ou-le-renforcement-des-stereotypes-an.htm "L'affaire al-Dura ou le renforcement des stéréotypes antijuifs..."], ''Le Meilleur des mondes'', September 2008.</ref><ref>{{fr icon}} Pierre-André Taguieff, ''La nouvelle propagande anti-juive'', Presses Universitaires de France, 2010.</ref> In the view of Charles Enderlin, the controversy is a smear campaign intended to undermine footage coming out of the occupied Palestinian territories.<ref name=Patience2007>Martin Patience, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7083129.stm "Dispute rages over al-Durrah footage"], BBC News, 8 November 2007.</ref> Doreen Carvjal wrote in ''The New York Times'' that the footage is "a cultural prism, with viewers seeing what they want to see."<ref name=Carvajal7Feb2005/>
