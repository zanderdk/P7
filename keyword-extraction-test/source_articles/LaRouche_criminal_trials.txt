The '''LaRouche criminal trials''' in the mid-1980s stemmed from federal and state investigations into the activities of American [[political activist]] [[Lyndon LaRouche]] and members of his movement. They were charged with conspiring to commit fraud and soliciting loans they had no intention of repaying.<ref name="LAT1989-01-27">{{Cite news|page = 1|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-27/news/mn-1754_1_prison-terms| author=Associated Press| title = LaRouche Gets 15 Years for Cheating His Backers, IRS 6 Aides Also Get Prison Terms, Fines|work = [[Los Angeles Times]]|date = January 27, 1989}}</ref> LaRouche and his supporters disputed the charges, claiming the trials were politically motivated.<ref name="LAT1989-01-27"/>

In 1986, hundreds of state and federal officers raided LaRouche offices in Virginia and Massachusetts. A federal grand jury in Boston, Massachusetts, indicted LaRouche and 12 associates on [[credit card fraud]] and [[obstruction of justice]]. The subsequent trial, described as an "extravaganza", was repeatedly delayed and ended in mistrial. Following the mistrial, a federal grand jury in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], indicted LaRouche and six associates. After a short trial in 1988, LaRouche was convicted of [[mail fraud]], [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit mail fraud, and [[tax evasion]], and was sentenced to prison for fifteen years. He entered prison in 1989 and was [[paroled]] five years later. At the same trial, his associates received lesser sentences for mail fraud and conspiracy.<ref name="LAT1989-01-27"/> In separate state trials in Virginia and New York, 13 associates received terms ranging from one month to 77 years.

Three LaRouche-related organizations were forced into bankruptcy after failing to pay [[contempt of court]] fines.

Defense lawyers filed numerous unsuccessful appeals that challenged the conduct of the grand jury, the contempt fines, the execution of the search warrants and various trial procedures. At least ten appeals were heard by the [[United States court of appeals]], and three were appealed to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. Former [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[Ramsey Clark]] joined the defense team for two appeals.  Following the convictions, the LaRouche movement mounted failed attempts at [[exoneration]].<ref>{{cite news|page =N13|last=Ford|first=Brian|title=LaRouche Pushes For Exoneration|work = [[Tulsa World]]|date=August 20, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|page=9|author=Associated Press|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gfkvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eU0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4856,3596804&dq=larouche+pushes+for+exoneration&hl=en| title=Dems distance selves from Milton|date=August 25, 1999| accessdate=May 10, 2010}}</ref>

== Background ==
Beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Lyndon LaRouche formed a variety of political organizations, including the [[U.S. Labor Party]] and the National Democratic Policy Committee.<ref name="Murphy1988-12-17">{{cite news|page=A01|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/larouche/larou6.htm|title=LaRouche Convicted Of Mail Fraud|work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=December 17, 1988|last= Murphy|first=Caryle}}</ref> These organizations served as the platforms for [[Lyndon LaRouche U.S. Presidential campaigns|presidential campaigns by LaRouche]] starting in 1976,<ref>{{cite news|title=Group Makes Political Inroads|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/larouche/larou5.htm|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=January 13, 1985|first=John|last= Mintz}}</ref> and by his followers in scores of local races. According to one candidate, supporters viewed LaRouche as "the greatest political leader and economist of the 20th century, and they're proud to be associated with him. They feel he's leading the battle to save Western civilization."<ref>{{Cite news| pages = A.22| last = Toner| first = Robin| title = Democrats Scrutinize Larouche Bloc| work = New York Times| date = March 30, 1986}}</ref> The ''Survey of Jewish Affairs, 1987'' called the LaRouche movement one of the two most prominent "extremist political groups" of 1986.<ref>Frankel (1988), p. 202.</ref>

The movement's greatest electoral success came in 1986 when two supporters, [[Janice Hart]] and Mark J. Fairchild, won the Democratic Party nominations for [[Illinois Secretary of State]] and [[Lieutenant Governor of Illinois|Lieutenant Governor]].<ref>{{Cite news|page = A8|author = Associated Press|title = LaRouche Backers Lose Illinois Court Round|work = [[The New York Times]]|date = July 29, 1986|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE0DB153AF93AA15754C0A960948260}}</ref> Both lost in the general election. Also in 1986, the "Prevent AIDS Now Initiative Committee" (PANIC) got an [[initiative]] on the California ballot, [[California Proposition 64 (1986)|Proposition 64]] (also known as the "LaRouche Initiative"), which attracted widespread opposition and was defeated that November.

== Investigations ==

=== Early 1980s ===
According to arguments made by LaRouche's attorneys in later appeals, the government investigations were started under the FBI's [[COINTELPRO]] in the 1960s. Edward Spannaus, a defendant in the trials, further notes that there was a memorandum written on January 12, 1983, by former [[FBI]] chief [[William Hedgcock Webster|William Webster]] to [[Oliver "Buck" Revell]], head of the Bureau's General Investigative Division. It requested information on the funding of LaRouche and the [[U.S. Labor Party]], including whether the U.S. Labor Party might be funded by hostile intelligence agencies. The LaRouche organization asserts that this formulation was specifically tailored to enable FBI "active measures" against LaRouche under [[Executive Order 12333]], which permits such measures if a political movement receives foreign funding.<ref name="Hasyour">{{Cite web| title = Has your neighbor been brainwashed about Lyndon LaRouche?| accessdate = October 11, 2008| publisher=[[Schiller Institute]]|url = http://www.schillerinstitute.org/exon/exon_add2_train.html|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060920090608/http://www.schillerinstitute.org/exon/exon_add2_train.html |archivedate = September 20, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref> The memo was eventually obtained by LaRouche's attorneys and submitted as an exhibit in the 1987 trial of LaRouche and co-defendants in Boston.

=== Mid-1980s ===
In the mid-1980s, the U.S. government and eleven states began investigations into alleged financial improprieties by LaRouche groups. A federal [[grand jury]] reportedly began investigating "an extensive nationwide pattern of credit card fraud" by LaRouche organizations in November 1984.<ref name="BrinkleyB7" /> That same year a [[New Jersey]] bank froze the accounts of LaRouche's 1984 presidential campaign due to allegedly fraudulent credit-card charges.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{Cite news|page = A28|title = Abrams Files LaRouche Lawsuit|work = [[The New York Times]]|date = October 29, 1986|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DEFD8163EF93AA15753C1A960948260}}</ref>

In January 1985, the grand jury in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], subpoenaed documents from the National Democratic Policy Committee (NDPC), and three other LaRouche organizations: Caucus Distributors Inc., [[Fusion Energy Foundation]], and Campaigner Publications Inc. Seven weeks later, on March 29, 1985, a U.S. District Court Judge [[A. David Mazzone]] held them to be in contempt and fined them $45,000 per day. The fines for all the organizations eventually totaled over $20&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite news|page = A15|author= Associated Press|title = LaRouche Groups to Appeal|work = [[The New York Times]]|date = March 5, 1987|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DD133FF936A35750C0A961948260}}</ref> The same grand jury subpoenaed Elliot I.

Investigations by a separate federal grand jury in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], along with state agencies in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[California]], [[Minnesota]], [[Illinois]] and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] were also underway.<ref name="NYT1987-02-18">{{Cite news|page = A21|author= Associated Press|title = 16 LaRouche Aides Indicted For Fraud|work = [[The New York Times]]|date = February 2, 1987|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D9143EF93BA25751C0A961948260}}</ref> The FBI, IRS, [[Federal Election Commission|FEC]]<ref>{{Cite news|page= A2|last = Osborne|first = William|title = Gifts to LaRouche are probed: San Diego widow loaned $34,300 to L.A. group|work = [[The San Diego Union]]|date = April 8, 1986}}</ref> and personnel of other federal agencies were conducting separate investigations.

[[File:Wheat Building-Leesburg VA.jpg|thumb|upright|The Wheat Building in Leesburg, Virginia: one of the buildings searched during the 1986 raid.]]
Beginning October 6, 1986, the [[Leesburg, Virginia]], headquarters of the LaRouche organization was searched in a coordinated, two-day raid by hundreds of officers of the FBI, [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]], other federal agencies, and Virginia state authorities, supported by armored cars and a helicopter. The agents also surrounded LaRouche's heavily guarded estate<ref>{{Cite news|page= 1|title = Jury finds LaRouche guilty in conspiracy and mail fraud plot|work = [[Houston Chronicle]]|date = December 17, 1988}}</ref> for the duration of the search but did not enter it.<ref>"[http://www.usdoj.gov/osg/briefs/1989/sg890463.txt Brief for the United States in Opposition]", ''National Democratic Policy Committee v.

Warren J. Hamerman, Chair of the NDPC, said the searches "conducted by [[Donald Regan]]'s associate William Weld's forces against presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche's headquarters coincides with Don Regan's desperate attempts to maintain the cover-up on [[AIDS]]".<ref>{{Cite news|page= A1|last = Reid|first = Christine|title = 10 LaRouche Associates Face Fraud Counts; Offices Raided|work = [[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]|date = October 7, 1986}}</ref> LaRouche later said that the Soviet Premier had ordered the raid as part of an assassination attempt.

On the same day as the Leesburg search, the Boston grand jury handed down a 117-count indictment that named ten LaRouche associates, two corporations, and three campaign committees. Authorities charged them with making unauthorized credit charges that defrauded $1&nbsp;million from over 1,000 people. The charges also included a scheme to raise funds by soliciting loans with no intention of repaying them. The [[National Caucus of Labor Committees]] was charged, along with others, of conspiring to obstruct justice. Prosecutors charged that defendants had burned records, sent potential grand jury witnesses out of the country, and failed to provide subpoenaed evidence. The indictment quoted LaRouche telling an associate that, in reaction to legal problems, "we are going to stall, tie them up in the courts ... just keep stalling, stall and appeal, stall and appeal".<ref>{{Cite news|page= A1|last = Shenon|first = Philip|title = U.S. Charges Aides To LaRouche With Credit-Card Fraud Scheme|work = [[The New York Times]]|date = October 7, 1986}}</ref> Three of the indicted associates remained at large for over a year,<ref>{{Cite news|page= A25|author= Associated Press|title = Prosecutor Links Fraud To LaRouche|work = [[The New York Times]]|date = December 18, 1987|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4DB103BF93BA25751C1A961948260}}</ref> and investigators were allegedly given false information.

== Involuntary bankruptcy ==
[[File:15B Catoctin Circle Leesburg VA.jpg|thumb|Former [[Fusion Energy Foundation]] headquarters, photographed in 2008]]
In early April 1987, the government charged in court that LaRouche organizations may have been trying to sell properties for cash to more easily conceal their assets and avoid paying $21.4&nbsp;million in contempt of court fines.<ref>{{Cite news|page= 1|last = Jackson|first = Robert L.|title = 3 Firms Linked to LaRouche Seized for Fines|work = [[Los Angeles Times]]|date = April 22, 1987}}</ref> The U.S. Department of Justice filed an [[involuntary bankruptcy]] petition on April 20, 1987, to collect the debt from Caucus Distributors Inc., [[Fusion Energy Foundation]], and Campaigner Publications Inc.

The bankruptcy halted the publication of a weekly newspaper, ''New Solidarity'', and a bi-monthly science magazine, ''[[Fusion (magazine)|Fusion]]''.

The attorneys who represented the LaRouche entities in the bankruptcy trial filed a brief stating that the action was unprecedented and improper, alleging that it deviated from the standard rules of involuntary bankruptcy, and that members of the Alexandria prosecution team from the second criminal trial were involved in the planning and execution of the bankruptcy.<ref>"Proposed Findings of Fact in cases 87-0795-A,87-0796-A,87-0797-A", published in Spannaus (1989).</ref>

=== Trial of LaRouche, et al. ===
The trial of LaRouche and his six co-defendants, ''U.S. v. LaRouche Campaign'', began on December 17, 1987, with the jury that had been picked in September, before the Frankhouser trial. The 12 defense lawyers made 400 pretrial motions.<ref>{{Cite news|page= A14|last = Murphy|first = Caryle|title = LaRouche's Va.

The prosecution argued that pressure to fill fund raising quotas had led to 2,000 instances of credit card fraud, and that organization members had sought to obstruct the investigation. The defense presented the case that the prosecution was the culmination of a 20-year campaign of harassment by the FBI and CIA, and that the prosecution was acting on the orders of the CIA when they destroyed evidence and hid witnesses.<ref>{{Cite news|page = 74|last = Doherty|first =William F. |title = LaRouche Called Donors 'Slime,' Prosecution Says|work = [[The Boston Globe]]|date = December 18, 1987}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|page= A6|last = Mintz|first = John|title = Trial of LaRouche and 7 Aides May Be Delayed; Case of One Defendant May Be Severed, Heard First in Boston Federal Court|work = [[The Washington Post]]|date = October 20, 1987}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|page= A14|last = Mintz|first = John|title = Jury Selection Begins in LaRouche Fraud Case; Lawyers Say Trial, Which Could Last 3 Months, Promises to Be One of the Strangest|work = [[The Washington Post]]|date = September 22, 1987}}</ref>

Judge [[Albert V. Bryan Jr.]] presided over ''U.S. v. LaRouche'' in the [[U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]], where LaRouche resided. That court was known as a "[[rocket docket]]" for its speed in disposing of cases.  LaRouche and six associates were indicted on October 14, 1988 on charges of [[mail fraud]] and [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit mail fraud.<ref>{{Cite news|page= B7|last = Green|first = Frank|title = Clark Joins Motion Seeking Bond For LaRouche Appeal|work = [[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]|date = April 7, 1989}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|page= 3|last = Stern|first = Seth|title = Terror trials head for Virginia 'rocket docket'|work = [[Christian Science Monitor]]|date = February 6, 2002|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0206/p03s01-usju.html}}</ref>  Trial was scheduled for six weeks after the indictment.

Judge Bryan granted a prosecution motion ''[[in limine]]'', ruling that the defense would not be permitted to discuss, or even allude to, the fact that the indebted entities had been placed in involuntary bankruptcy. It also excluded claims of vindictive prosecution and political harassment by the government.<ref name="896.F2d.815"/><ref>Government's Motion in Limine, ''United States v.

The prosecution, led by Assistant U.S. Attorney Kent Robinson, presented evidence that LaRouche and his staff solicited US$34&nbsp;million in loans since 1983 with false assurances to potential lenders and showed "reckless disregard for the truth".<ref>{{Cite news|page= A46|last = Murphy|first = Carlyle|title = LaRouche Trial Hears Closing Arguments|work = [[The Washington Post]]|date = December 15, 1988}}</ref> In his opening statement to the trial, Robinson said, "Members of the jury, this case is about money. It's about how the defendants got money, and to a lesser extent, what they did with that money when they got it&nbsp;... The defendants, all seven of them, are charged in engaging in a scheme to defraud. That is, to obtain those loans by making false promises, false pretences, saying things to potential lenders which they knew weren't true."<ref>Transcript of Record, ''United States v. LaRouche'', Criminal No. 88-00243-A ([[E.D. Va.]] 1988). Reprinted in Spannaus (1989).</ref>

The most important evidence was the testimony of lenders,<ref name="Murphy1988-12-17"/> many of them elderly retirees, who had loaned a total of $661,300 to help LaRouche fight the "war on drugs" but only received $10,000 in repayment.<ref name="Murphy1988-12-17"/> One of the prosecutors, John Markham, said those loans represented "just a very small portion of unrepaid borrowing". Other testimony asserted that, as of 1987, half of the $4&nbsp;million borrowed by the 1984 presidential campaign was unpaid, and that only $5&nbsp;million had been repaid out of $30&nbsp;million in non-campaign loans.<ref name="Murphy1988-12-17"/> LaRouche supporters claim the unrepaid amount was $294,000 but, according to testimony at trial, the amount owed by 1987 topped $25&nbsp;million.<ref name="Murphy1988-12-17"/>

Several witnesses were LaRouche followers who testified under immunity from prosecution.<ref name="Murphy1988-12-17"/> A former fundraiser testified that he was told, "No matter what the person you are talking to says, get the money. [...] If you are talking to an unemployed worker who says he has got to feed ... a dozen children, forget it. Get the money. Most of these people are immoral anyway. This is the most moral thing they have ever done is to give you money."<ref name="896.F2d.815"/>

None of the defendants testified.<ref name="896.F2d.815"/> Outside of court, LaRouche denied all the charges, calling them "an all-out frame-up by a state and federal task force," and said that the federal government was trying to kill him. "The purpose of this frame-up is not to send me to prison. It's to kill me," LaRouche said. "In prison it's fairly easy to kill me ... If this sentence goes through, I'm dead."<ref name="Murphy1988-12-17"/>

One of the charges against LaRouche was that he had conspired to avoid paying income tax, not having filed a return in ten years.<ref name="Oilman">{{Cite news|author=Associated Press|title =Conservative Oilman Pays Rent For LaRouche Estate|work = [[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]] |location=Fort Lauderdale|date = May 3, 1986|page=6A}}</ref> LaRouche claimed to have had no income. LaRouche lived on a 172-acre (700,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) estate near [[Leesburg, Virginia]], with a pond and horse ring.

As part of the trial in Alexandria, six of LaRouche's associates were also found guilty. His chief fund-raiser, William Wertz, was convicted on ten mail fraud counts.

=== Appeal of convictions ===
[[Image:Ramsey Clark in Nandigram cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ramsey Clark]] in 2007.]]
The defendants in the Alexandria trial appealed their convictions to [[Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals]] on October 6, 1989. Former U.S. Attorney General [[Ramsey Clark]] joined the defense team, which contended that there were six faults in the trial. In the words of the Circuit Court's opinion, the alleged errors were:<ref name="896.F2d.815">{{cite court |litigants=U.S. v. LaRouche |vol= 896 |reporter= F.2d |opinion= 815|pinpoint= |court= 4th Cir. |date= January 22, 1990 |url= http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/896/896.F2d.815.89-5518.html |quote=}}</ref>
# The district court erred in denying their motion for a continuance of the trial date.
# The district court erroneously denied their discovery request for exculpatory material.
# The district court made numerous evidentiary rulings, ''[[in limine]]'' and at trial, that unconstitutionally restricted their ability to defend against the charges.
# The trial judge failed to conduct a ''[[voir dire]]'' sufficient to impanel an unbiased jury and improperly failed to excuse several jurors for cause.
# The mail fraud counts were improperly joined with the tax conspiracy count.
# The sentence imposed on LaRouche was excessive.
# The district court erroneously instructed the jury on the tax count.
# The district court erred in allowing the introduction of illegally seized evidence.
Seventeen ''[[amicus curiae]]'' ("friend of the court") briefs were filed in the appeal. One, by Albert Bleckmann, director of the Institute for Public Law and Political Sciences at the [[University of Münster]], objected to the lack of ''voir dire'', the exclusion of evidence under the motion ''in limine'', the fact that the government did not approach LaRouche about his tax situation before indicting him for tax violations, and concerns about [[double jeopardy]] because of the nearly identical charges in the Boston and Alexandria trials.<ref>''United States v.

== State trials ==
[[File:Leesburg VA law offices.jpg|left|thumb|Law offices of the LaRouche movement during the state trials (photographed in 2008).]]
The Attorney General of Virginia, [[Mary Sue Terry]], prosecuted eight LaRouche organizations on charges of [[securities fraud]] relating to $30&nbsp;million in loans. The first trials were in Leesburg, but later trials moved to the larger city of [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]]. In order for the prosecutions to proceed, a decision by the [[State Corporation Commission]] (SCC) was needed verifying that the loans solicited by LaRouche organizations were [[Security (finance)|securities]]. Attorneys for the LaRouche organizations argued that a prohibition on raising funds through loans would violate their [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights. The SCC rejected that argument and decided, on March 4, 1987, that the [[promissory note]]s were securities. It ordered six LaRouche organizations—[[Fusion Energy Foundation|Fusion Energy Foundation Inc.]], Caucus Distributors Inc., Publication and General Management Inc., Campaigner Publications Inc., EIR News Service Inc. and Publication Equities Inc.—to stop their sale.<ref>{{Cite news|page = A1|last = McKelway|first = Bill|title = SCC Enjoins LaRouche Groups|work = [[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]|date = March 5, 1987}}</ref> Five other states had already issued [[injunction]]s,<ref>{{Cite news|page = B8|last = McKelway|first = Bill|title = Briefs Filed In LaRouche Probe|work = [[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]|date = February 28, 1987}}</ref> and 14 states eventually followed.

Under Virginia's court system, the jury determines prison terms although a judge may override the jury's recommendation. The jury in this case recommended 77 years (out of a possible 90); the judge refused to lower it because Billington continued to insist upon his innocence (which the judge deemed lack of remorse) and because he had warned that he would accept the jury recommendation if Billington requested a jury trial. Billington served a total of ten years in prison before being released on parole. The lead prosecutor said the case involved "willful and massive fraud that has caused a lot of people to suffer".<ref>{{Cite news|page = B3|title = LaRouche Fund-Raiser Convicted|work = [[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]|date = October 25, 1989}}</ref>

== Reactions from LaRouche and supporters ==
"My imprisonment is the American [[Dreyfus affair|Dreyfus case]]", LaRouche said in a January 1989 interview from prison. The prosecutor denied claims of a conspiracy, describing the theory as an "[[George Orwell|Orwellian]] fantasy ... that we are hiding some supersecret spy plot which, if exposed, would exonerate them".<ref name="Neuffer1989-03-22"/> LaRouche supporters insisted that LaRouche was jailed, not for any violation of the law, but for his beliefs.

LaRouche also alleged systematic government misconduct:
<blockquote>The record shows, that for nearly thirty years, elements of the U.S. Department of Justice have been engaged in world-wide political targeting of me and my associates. This includes early 1970s operations run in conjunction with Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's U.S. State Department. During the last ten years or so of that period, some U.S. officials, and others, have challenged the relevant agencies with some of the evidence which shows, that those prosecutions and correlated harassment of me and my associates, had been clearly fraudulent, politically motivated targeting.<ref>{{Cite web| title = LaRouche—Bad Guy, But We Can't Say Why| publisher=[[Schiller Institute]]| accessdate=October 12, 2008| url = http://schillerinstitute.org/exon/lar_bad_guy.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20020615190445/http://schillerinstitute.org/exon/lar_bad_guy.html |archivedate = June 15, 2002}}</ref></blockquote>

LaRouche and his lawyers asserted that the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) sought to destroy his organization, and that the prosecution was the result of a conspiracy between the ADL, the government and the media.<ref>{{Cite news|page= A42|last = Howard|first = Alison|title = Lyndon LaRouche Leaves Prison to Testify for Fund-Raiser|work = [[The Washington Post]]|date = May 24, 1990}}</ref> This claim stemmed from a series of meetings that LaRouche publications refer to as the [[John Train (investment advisor)|John Train]] "Salon".<ref name="Hasyour" />

In testimony submitted to the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] on July 13, 1998, the LaRouche-affiliated [[Schiller Institute]] claimed that "[t]he inability to repay lenders and other crediters [sic] was the consequence of an unprecedented [[involuntary bankruptcy]] proceeding initiated by the Justice Department against those companies in 1987, initiated in an ''[[ex parte]]'', ''[[in camera]]'' proceeding".<ref>{{Cite web| title = Testimony Of The Schiller Institute Submitted To The Committee On The Judiciary, UnitedStates Senate| publisher= american_almanac.tipod.com|accessdate= October 12, 2008| date = July 13, 1998| url = http://american_almanac.tripod.com/dojtest.htm}}</ref>

[[Friedrich August Freiherr von der Heydte]], a professor of [[constitutional law|constitutional]] and [[international law]] at the [[University of Mainz]] in Germany, compared the LaRouche trial to the [[Dreyfus affair]], which he called "a classical example of a political trial". He wrote, "Just as LaRouche was, the French Capt. Alfred Dreyfus was deprived by the structure of the trial procedures, of any opportunity to prove his innocence, and facts critical for his defense were excluded from the trial."<ref>This paragraph is excerpted from a longer essay by von der Heydte, which appeared as a full page ad, sponsored by the LaRouche-affiliated Commission to investigate Human Rights Violations, in ''[[The Washington Times]]'' on March 1, 1990, in ''Loudoun Times-Mirror'' of Loudon County, Virginia on March 2, and as a half-page ad in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' on March 3. Re-printed in Spannaus (1989).</ref>

On November 8, 1991, Angelo Vidal d'Almeida Ribeiro, the [[Special Rapporteur]] for the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]], filed a request to the U.S. Government based on a complaint that had been filed concerning the LaRouche case. The U.S. government responded by saying that LaRouche had been given due process under the laws of the United States. The U.N. Commission took no further action.<ref>{{Cite web | first= Angelo Vidal d'Almeida |last=Ribeiro | title = Report by the Special Rapporteur| publisher = [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]]|accessdate= October 11, 2008| date = March 10, 1986| url = http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/Symbol/E.CN.4.1993.62.En?Opendocument}}</ref>

== Exoneration attempts ==
Ramsey Clark wrote a letter in 1995 to then-Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] in which he said that the case involved "a broader range of deliberate and systematic misconduct and abuse of power over a longer period of time in an effort to destroy a political movement and leader, than any other federal prosecution in my time or to my knowledge". He asserted that, "The government, ex parte, sought and received an order effectively closing the doors of these publishing businesses, all of which were involved in First Amendment activities, effectively preventing the further repayment of their debts." He called the convictions "a tragic miscarriage of justice which at this time can only be corrected by an objective review and courageous action by the Department of Justice".<ref>{{Cite web| last = Clark| first = Ramsey | title = Letter from former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark to Attorney General Janet Reno | work = LaRouche in 2004|accessdate= October 11, 2008| date = April 26, 1995| url = http://larouchein2004.net/exoneration/clarkletter.htm |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061221170153/http://larouchein2004.net/exoneration/clarkletter.htm |archivedate = December 21, 2006}}</ref> The LaRouche movement organized two panels to review the cases: the Curtis Clark Commission,<ref>{{Cite web| title = The Curtis Clark Commission Findings: Exonerate Lyndon LaRouche |accessdate = October 11, 2008| date = September 3, 1994| work = LaRouche in 2004| url = http://larouchein2004.net/exoneration/exonappendix1.htm |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20031219040856/http://larouchein2004.net/exoneration/exonappendix1.htm |archivedate = December 19, 2003}}</ref> and the [[Schiller Institute#Mann-Chestnut hearings|Mann-Chestnut hearings]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = Statement of Mann-Chestnut Commission|publisher=[[Schiller Institute]] |accessdate = October 11, 2008| url = http://www.larouchepub.com/pr/1997/schiller_pr_04-21-97.html|format=Press release}}</ref>

On September 18, 1996, a full-page advertisement appeared in the ''New Federalist'', a LaRouche publication, as well as ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[Roll Call]]''. Entitled "Officials Call for LaRouche's Exoneration", its signatories included [[Arturo Frondizi]], former [[President of Argentina]]; figures from the 1960s [[American Civil Rights Movement]] such as [[Amelia Boynton Robinson]] (a leader of the Larouche-affiliated [[Schiller Institute]]), [[James Bevel]] (a Larouche movement participant) and [[Rosa Parks]]; former [[Minnesota]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] and Democratic Presidential Candidate [[Eugene McCarthy]]; [[Mervyn M. Dymally]], who chaired the [[Congressional Black Caucus]]; and artists such as classical vocalist [[William Warfield]] and violinist [[Norbert Brainin]], former 1st Violin of the [[Amadeus Quartet]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = Exonerate LaRouche|accessdate = October 11, 2008| work = LaRouche in 2004| url = http://larouchein2004.net/exoneration/exonstatement.htm |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040228111029/http://larouchein2004.net/exoneration/exonstatement.htm |archivedate = February 28, 2004}} LaRouche's Schiller Institute paid for the advertisement. Amelia Boynton Robinson was at that time a board member of the Institute. James Bevel and William Warfield had been active in various LaRouche organizations.</ref>

== Later developments ==
In 2009, Molly Kronberg, widow of [[Kenneth Kronberg]], sued LaRouche in federal court for the Eastern District of Virginia, in Alexandria, alleging that he and his associates libelled and harassed her on account of her compelled testimony in the 1988 case which led to his conviction.<ref name=Wagoner>{{cite news|title=After suicide, Leesburg widow sues LaRouche|first= Jana|last= Wagoner |work=Loudoun Times-Mirror|date=August 25, 2009|url=http://www.loudountimes.com/news/2009/aug/25/after-suicide-leesburg-widow-sues-larouche/}}</ref> LaRouche alleges that Kronberg perjured herself and colluded with the prosecutors to frame him in order to cover up a bad check issued in 1979 by her from a [[New Benjamin Franklin House Publishing Company]] account for royalties owed him.<ref name=Wagoner/> One of the prosecutors in the 1988 case, John Markham, is representing Kronberg in the suit.<ref>{{cite news|title=LaRouche Sued For Libel, Harassment|first=Nicholas F. |last=Benton    |date=27 August 2009|work =Falls Church News-Press|url=http://www.fcnp.com/news/4920-larouche-sued-for-libel-harassment.html|accessdate=August 28, 2009}}</ref>
