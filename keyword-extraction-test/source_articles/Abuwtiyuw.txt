The [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] dog '''Abuwtiyuw''',{{sfn|Reisner|1936|p=96}} (IPA: ?-bwit-?ew) also transcribed as '''Abutiu''' (died before 2280 BC),{{sfn|Martin|1997|p=104}} was one of the earliest documented domestic animals whose name is known. He is believed to have been a royal guard dog who lived in the [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]] (2345–2181&nbsp;BC), and received an elaborate ceremonial burial in the [[Giza pyramid complex|Giza Necropolis]] at the behest of a pharaoh whose name is unknown.

An inscribed stone listing the gifts donated by the pharaoh for Abuwtiyuw's funeral was discovered by Egyptologist [[George Andrew Reisner|George A. Reisner]] in October 1935. It was apparently part of the [[spolia|spoil material]] incorporated into the structure of a Sixth&nbsp;Dynasty [[mastaba]] (pharaonic-era tomb) after the demolition of the funerary chapel belonging to Abuwtiyuw's owner, where the stone likely had originally been installed. The white [[limestone]] tablet measures 54.2×28.2×23.2&nbsp;cm (21.3×11.1×9.1&nbsp;in). The inscription is composed of ten vertical rows of hieroglyphs, separated by vertical lines.

Abuwtiyuw appears to have been a [[sighthound]], a lightly built hunting dog similar to a [[greyhound]], with erect ears and a curly tail. The tomb in which his tablet was discovered is in [[Giza West Field#Cemetery G2100|Cemetery G 2100]] in Giza West Field, close to the western side of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] ([[Pyramid of Khufu]]/Kheops).

[[Herodotus]] documents that in [[ancient Persia]] dogs were protected animals,{{sfn|Cavendish|2010|p=138}} held in the highest esteem during their lifetime.{{sfn|Hastings|2001|p=512}} According to the ancient Greeks<!--hard to believe they all said so; probably better to name names or say "some ancient Greek writers"-->, dogs in ancient Egypt were treated with the same respect as they were in Persia, and were commonly [[mummy|mummified]] after death before being buried in family tombs.{{sfn|Hastings|2001|p=512}}{{sfn|Teeter|2011|p=8}}{{sfn|Hinkler|2006|p=33}} The ancient Egyptians and others of the Near East believed that dogs were spiritual beings, similar to humans, and they were "often associated with particular deities and the powers they wield".{{sfn|Morey|2010|p=182}} A number of the early dynastic royal burial grounds contain the graves of dogs, along with women and servants of the royal household.{{sfn|Spence 2008|p=23}} [[Ashkelon]] cemetery in the [[South District (Israel)|South District]] of [[Israel]] is perhaps the best-documented dog cemetery in the ancient world, but dog mummies have been unearthed en masse in sites across Egypt including [[Rhoda Island|Rhoda]] in Upper Egypt,{{Sfn|Gardner Wilkinson|1837|p=33}} [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], and near [[Maghagha]].{{sfn|Morey|2010|p=182}}

The ancient Egyptians mummified many animal species, from cats and [[gazelle]]s to [[crocodile]]s, [[baboon]]s, and birds.{{sfn|Velde|Dijk|1997|p=56}}{{sfn|Detweiler|2004|p=170}}{{sfn|Lucas|2003|p=349}} Typically, many animal species were consumed as meat after death, but it is highly unlikely that dogs would have been eaten.{{sfn|Ikram|2005|p=24}} [[Radiograph]]s of exhumed dogs in the ancient world have revealed that the mummification process involved wrapping the embalmed bones together with bandages and placing them within a wooden statue of [[Anubis]], the [[Cynocephaly|jackal-headed]] [[Egyptian pantheon|deity]] associated with mummification and the [[Afterlife#Ancient Egypt|afterlife]] in [[ancient Egyptian religion]].{{sfn|Ikram|2005|p=24}}

==Discovery==
The only source from which Abuwtiyuw is known is a stone inscription tablet that may have come from the funerary chapel of the dog's owner.{{sfn|Reisner|1936|pp=97–98}} The tablet was apparently among spolia used to build another grave in approximately 2280 BC, a sixth-Dynasty [[mastaba]], after the chapel's demolition.{{sfn|Reisner|1936|p=96}}{{sfn|Martin|1997|p=104}} It was discovered on 13 October 1935 by Egyptologist [[George Andrew Reisner|George A. Reisner]] during a joint [[Harvard University]]-[[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]] expedition, and removed from the site four days later.{{sfn|Hayes|1990|p=65}}{{Sfn|Zahradnik|2009|p=207}}{{sfn|G2188 Y}}{{sfn|G2188}}

The find was recorded by the main expedition photographer, Mohammedani Ibrahim, who took more than 9,321 large-format glass-plate images on Reisner's expeditions.{{sfn|Photos: Abutiu}}{{sfn|Ragovin|2007}} The tablet is now held by the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo (inventory number JE&nbsp;67573).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:m_hTK3wYffAJ:www.telesangels.com.au/forum/request.php%3F46+&hl=en&gl=uk&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESgKJPMLM9VM2xR8X1KO8dnz3IXZSQR23sQAnGMH79uezyxhFoLD_AHYi1bki_cUXhf05JddkinF9zDQhCH5v2aS6WwMJUk-pCvGzd9xNDh8l2sHeQ8txUnBHAraoGKpyU9CpaWF&sig=AHIEtbQtnBqt7mrN3PxP1-sAiRsujqwX9g|title=Ancient History Basics|publisher=Telemachus Ancient History Mentor Program, Department of Ancient History, Faculty of Arts, [[Macquarie University]]|accessdate=21 October 2012}}</ref>

Neither the dog's grave nor mummy have been recovered.{{sfn|Reisner|1936|pp=96–97}} The tomb in which the tablet was unearthed is in [[Giza West Field#Cemetery G2100|Cemetery G 2100]] in Giza West Field, close to the western side of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] (Pyramid of [[Khufu]]/Kheops).{{Sfn|Miller|2012|p=154}}{{Sfn|Leach|1961|p=283}} The white [[limestone]] tablet measures 54.2×28.2×23.2&nbsp;cm (21.3×11.1×9.1&nbsp;in) and is inscribed with ten vertical rows of hieroglyphs, separated from each other by vertical lines. Part of a [[leash]] is visible on the upper-right corner, suggesting that the tablet displayed an image of Abuwtiyuw with his owner.{{sfn|Reisner|1936|pp=96–97}}

The text of the inscription translated by Reisner describes the gifts offered by the pharaoh in tribute at Abuwtiyuw's funeral:

{{quote|The dog which was the guard of His Majesty, Abuwtiyuw is his name. His Majesty ordered that he be buried (ceremonially), that he be given a coffin from the royal treasury, fine linen in great quantity, (and) incense. His Majesty (also) gave perfumed ointment, and (ordered) that a tomb be built for him by the gangs of masons. His Majesty did this for him in order that he (the dog) might be Honoured (before the great god, Anubis).{{sfn|Reisner|1936|p=97}}}}

==Interpretation==
[[File:Tesem.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Image of a [[Tesem]] dog from the grave of [[Intef II]], c. 2065 BC]]
Although it was common to bury dogs in ancient Egypt, the funeral of Abuwtiyuw was unusually elaborate, an honour normally reserved for upper-class humans.{{sfn|Reisner|1936|p=96}} The pharaoh's gifts suggest that the corpse was mummified, as was commonly done with humans at the time, in the belief that the ''[[Ka (Egyptian soul)#Ka (vital spark)|Ka]]'' of the dead would enter into its afterlife through the ceremonial burial.{{sfn|Reisner|1936|p=99}}

Although no images of Abuwtiyuw have been found, the text characterizes him as ''?sm'' ([[Tesem]]), a lightly built hunting dog similar to a [[greyhound]], with erect ears and a curly tail. The Tesem dog features in [[Prehistoric Egypt|predynastic]] depictions, making it one of the oldest known breeds of dog, and images of it are common throughout Ancient Egyptian history.{{sfn|Reisner|1936|p=99}} According to Reisner, the name "Abuwtiyuw" is not fully translatable, but he surmised that ''bw'' ''("bu")'' is an [[Onomatopoesis|onomatopoeic]] representation of a dog's bark, as this component often is found in Ancient Egyptian dog names.{{sfn|Reisner|1936|p=99}} Edward C. Martin Jr. claims that the name, or its variant transliteration of ''Abutiu'', means "With Pointed Ears", which would fit the description of the Tesem.{{sfn|Martin|1997|p=104}}{{Clear}}
