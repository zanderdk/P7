The state laws governing [[alcoholic beverages]] in [[New Jersey]] are among the most complex [[Alcohol laws of the United States|in the United States]], with many peculiarities not found in other states' laws. They provide for 29 distinct liquor licenses granted to manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and for the public warehousing and transport of alcoholic beverages. General authority for the [[Statute|statutory]] and [[Regulation|regulatory]] control of alcoholic beverages rests with the state government, particularly the [[New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control|Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control]] overseen by the state's [[New Jersey Attorney General|Attorney General]].

Under [[home rule]], [[New Jersey]] law grants individual [[municipality|municipalities]] substantial discretion in passing [[municipal ordinance|ordinances]] regulating the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages within their limits. The number of retail licenses available is determined by a municipality's population, and may be further limited by the town's governing body. As a result, the availability of alcohol and regulations governing it vary significantly from town to town. A small percentage of municipalities in the state are "[[Dry county|dry towns]]" that do not allow alcoholic beverages to be sold, and do not issue retail licenses for bars or restaurants to serve alcohol to patrons. Other towns permit alcohol sales 24 hours a day. Retail licenses tend to be difficult to obtain, and when available are subject to exorbitant prices and fervent competition.

In addition to granting local governments wide latitude over liquor sales, New Jersey law has some other unusual features. Corporations are limited to two retail distribution licenses, making it impractical for [[chain stores]] to sell alcoholic beverages; this restriction, in conjunction with municipal ordinances, severely limits [[supermarket]] and [[convenience store]] chains from selling beer as they do in many other states. State law treats [[driving under the influence|drunk driving]] as a traffic offense rather than a crime, and permits individual municipalities to define the scope of [[minor in possession|underage drinking]] laws.

==History==
New Jersey's history of [[tavern]]s and alcohol production dates to its early colonial period. Colonial winemakers received recognition by the [[Royal Society of Arts]] for producing high-quality wine,<ref name="Westrich">[https://books.google.com/books?id=KgwXCT8eiY8C&pg=PP1 Westrich, Sal. ''New Jersey Wine: A Remarkable History.'' (Charleston, SC: The History Press, 2012).

Retrieved 19 July 2012.</ref> Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, the industry developed with the influx of European immigrants, specifically [[German-Americans|Germans]] and [[Italian-Americans|Italians]], who presented a sizable market for alcoholic beverages and brought with them old world winemaking, brewing, and distilling techniques.<ref name="Westrich"/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=trySQQAACAAJ&dq=jersey+brew&hl=en&sa=X&ei=4KAiUY-SJerx0wGahYGAAw&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA Pellegrino, Michael. ''Jersey Brew.'' (Wantage, NJ: Pellegrino & Feldstein, 2009). ISBN 9780976523314.]</ref> With the rise of the [[temperance movement]] culminating in [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] (1919–1933), New Jersey's alcohol industry suffered; many [[brewery|breweries]], [[winery|wineries]], and [[distillery|distilleries]] either closed or relocated to other states.<ref name="Wine Bible">[https://books.google.com/books?id=okibbSs7LxUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=wine+bible&hl=en&sa=X&ei=o6AiUar-H46w0AHkhIGgAQ&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA MacNeil, Karen. ''The Wine Bible.'' (New York: Workman Publishing Company, 2001). ISBN 9781563054341.]</ref> The legacy of Prohibition restricted and prevented the industry's recovery until the state legislature began loosening restrictions and repealing Prohibition-era laws starting in 1981. New Jersey's alcohol industry is experiencing a renaissance, and recently enacted laws provide new opportunities for the state's wineries and breweries.

==Controlling authority==

===Statewide statutes and enforcement===
New Jersey's laws and regulations regarding alcohol are overseen by the [[New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety|Department of Law and Public Safety]]'s Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC), which is managed by the state's Attorney General.<ref>[http://law.onecle.com/new-jersey/33-intoxicating-liquors/1-3.html N.J.S.A. 33:1–3.]</ref><ref name="Question1NJDivABCFAQ">New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control.

Starting in 1738, towns in New Jersey began issuing [[liquor license]]s to tavern keepers. Before federal [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] in 1919, despite many state liquor statutes, the regulation of alcoholic beverages in New Jersey was almost exclusively local, with wide variations among municipalities.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1JcZAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22Senate%20of%20the%20State%20of%20New%20Jersey%22%201911&pg=PA5877#v=onepage&q=liquor&f=false ''Compiled Statutes of New Jersey, Vol. V.''

New Jersey's alcohol laws and regulations are codified in Title 33 of the New Jersey Statutes, and Title 13, Chapter 2 of the [[New Jersey Administrative Code]] respectively.<ref>[http://law.onecle.com/new-jersey/33-intoxicating-liquors/index.html N.J.S.A. 33], known as "Intoxicating Liquors."</ref><ref>N.J.A.C. 13:2, known as "Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control."</ref> After New Jersey's current [[New Jersey State Constitution|state constitution]] was adopted in 1947 and some departments were consolidated, the department was incorporated into the Department of Law and Public Safety under the New Jersey Attorney General's office.<ref name="ABC history"/> The statutes define an alcoholic beverage as "any fluid or solid capable of being converted into a fluid, suitable for human consumption, and having an alcohol content of more than one-half of one per centum (1/2 of 1%) by volume, including [[ethanol|alcohol]], [[beer]], [[lager|lager beer]], [[ale]], [[porter (beer)|porter]], naturally fermented wine, treated wine, blended wine, [[fortified wine]], [[sparkling wine]], [[distilled liquor]]s, blended distilled liquors and any brewed, fermented or distilled liquors fit for use for beverage purposes or any mixture of the same, and fruit juices."<ref>[http://law.onecle.com/new-jersey/33-intoxicating-liquors/1-1.html N.J.S.A. 33:1–1(b).]</ref>

===Municipal control===
[[File:Ocean City New Jersey Ferris Wheel.JPG|thumb|right|Ocean City was founded in 1879 as a dry town, and it never has issued a liquor license, forbids the sale of alcohol, and prohibits BYOB at restaurants.|alt=A view over a town early in the morning with a power plant smokestack in the background]]

New Jersey has a strong tradition of municipal [[home rule]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=o0BmBWloogcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Karcher, Alan. ''New Jersey's Multiple Municipal Madness.'' (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1989). ISBN 9780813525662.]</ref> Local municipalities thus have considerable authority in the licensing and regulating of alcohol-related businesses. These powers include:<ref name="NJSA33:1-40">[http://law.onecle.com/new-jersey/33-intoxicating-liquors/1-40.html N.J.S.A. 33:1–40.]</ref>
* limiting the number of licenses to sell alcoholic beverages at retail (Class C licenses),
* limiting the hours of retail alcohol sales,
* prohibiting the retail sale of alcoholic beverages on Sunday,
* regulating the conduct of any retail establishment licensed to sell alcoholic beverages,
* regulating the nature and condition of the licensed premises
* limiting persons within the municipality to a single liquor license,
* limiting a license to cover only the specific licensed premises; and
* allowing municipalities with populations of 15,000 or more to appoint a municipal alcoholic beverage control board of three persons with terms for three years.<ref>[http://law.onecle.com/new-jersey/33-intoxicating-liquors/1-5.html N.J.S.A. 33:1–5]</ref>

Retail licenses for consumption or distribution are allocated proportionally to a municipality's population. Licenses permitting on-premises retail sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages (i.e. bars and restaurants) are allocated at a ratio of one license for 3,000 residents. Distribution licenses are available at a ratio of one license per 7,500 residents.<ref name="Question13NJDivABCFAQ">New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control. [http://www.state.nj.us/lps/abc/faqs.html#13 "ABC Frequently Asked Questions."] (Question #13: How many liquor stores and restaurants are allowed in each municipality?). Retrieved 26 January 2013.</ref> Small towns with populations less than 1,000 can issue at least one consumption and one distribution license.<ref>[http://law.onecle.com/new-jersey/33-intoxicating-liquors/1-12.15.html N.J.S.A. 33:1–12.15.]</ref> Given the regulatory latitude allowed municipalities, the actual number of licenses extant in a municipality may more or less depend on a variety of factors, including:
* whether the municipality's existing licenses were [[grandfather clause|grandfathered]] by predating the 1948 imposition of statutory limits on the number of retail licenses per town,<ref>Goldstein, Howard (liquor license broker). [http://newjerseyliquorlicensesareus.com/state-of-liquor-licenses-in-2012/ "State of liquor licenses in 2012"] (professional website) (3 January 2013). Retrieved 8 February 2013.</ref>
* whether the town has decided to offer fewer licenses, and
* whether the municipality has decided by ordinance or referendum to become dry, and prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages within its limits.
Because the law grants a municipality significant regulatory latitude, 35 of the state's 565 municipalities are currently dry.<ref name="dry towns">New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control. "[[:File:New Jersey Dry Town Listing.pdf|New Jersey ABC list of dry towns]]" (1 May 2013). Retrieved 22 July 2013.</ref> Conversely, because of the grandfathering of licenses, several municipalities have a substantially higher ratio of licenses. For instance, the [[resort town]] of [[Wildwood, New Jersey|Wildwood]] has a permanent population of 5,300, but 61 active liquor licenses.<ref>Gilfillian, Trudy. [http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/breaking/wildwood-considers-beach-bars-among-ways-to-increase-revenue/article_3e1eecb8-56a1-11e1-9aed-0019bb2963f4.html "Wildwood considers beach bars among ways to increase revenue"] in ''[[The Press of Atlantic City]]'' (14 February 2012).

==Municipal issues==

===Availability of retail liquor licenses===
[[File:Wildwood Liquor Store.jpg|thumb|right|A sign lights up a liquor store in Wildwood, which has more than 60 active liquor licenses.|alt=A green and orange neon sign that says "self service drive in liquors," and has an arrow pointing downward.]]
The number of Class C retail licenses for bars, restaurants, and liquor stores is limited by population and often by municipal ordinances. Licenses are typically obtained from existing licensees who choose to sell, or when a new license is offered as a town's population grows. As a result, the price for a retail license is often prohibitively expensive. The sale of a new license is usually conducted by [[public auction]]. The intense competition can benefit a town by generating several hundred thousand dollars of revenue from the highest bidder. A 2006 license auction in [[Cherry Hill, New Jersey]] set the state record at $1.5 million.<ref>Colimore, Edward.

In New Jersey, restrictive laws guarantee extravagant prices."] in ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' (29 June 2006). Retrieved 29 January 2013.</ref>

Supermarkets, convenience stores, and gas stations in New Jersey rarely sell alcoholic beverages because state law prohibits any person or corporation from possessing more than two retail distribution licenses.<ref>[http://law.onecle.com/new-jersey/33-intoxicating-liquors/1-12.31.html N.J.S.A. 33:1–12.31.]</ref> While licenses for bars, restaurants and liquor stores are limited, other retail licenses are not. Class C licenses can be granted without limit for [[common carrier]]s (such as [[limousine]]s and boats), private clubs with a minimum of 60 members, [[hotel]]s with at least one-hundred rooms, and [[theatre]]s with at least 1,000 seats.<ref name="municipal handbook"/>

===Distilleries===
{{See also|New Jersey distilled spirits}}

New Jersey has had a long distilling history dating to the colonial era when large landowners converted surplus fruit into brandy, sugar into rum, and grain into whiskey. Until recently, New Jersey had only one licensed distillery, [[Laird & Company]] in [[Scobeyville, New Jersey|Scobeyville]] ([[Colts Neck Township, New Jersey|Colts Neck]]). Founded by Robert Laird, it is the oldest licensed distillery in the United States and received License No. 1 from the [[U.S. Department of the Treasury]] in 1780. George Washington, who was acquainted with the distillery's owner, once asked him for his recipe for "cyder spirits."<ref name="JerseyLightningNJMag" />  By 1834, New Jersey boasted 388 distilleries.<ref name="Westrich"/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books/about/A_History_of_Wine_in_America.html?id=fmcwfK5G_YkC Pinney, Thomas.

Today, Laird is the nation's only remaining producer of [[Applejack (beverage)|applejack]]. Presently none of the company's distilling takes place in New Jersey. Laird's obtains all its apples from Virginia's [[Shenandoah Valley]] and distills its products in Virginia.

===Direct shipping to consumers===
{{See also|Wine shipping laws in the United States}}
Until 2004, New Jersey permitted in-state wineries to directly ship products to in-state customers. The state did not allow out-of-state producers to ship to New Jersey residents or permit New Jersey wineries to ship to out-of-state customers. This practice was declared unconstitutional by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in 2005 in a case from [[Michigan]]. New Jersey's statute was subsequently struck down by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|Third Circuit Court of Appeals]] in 2010 because such limitations were held to violate the [[Interstate Commerce Clause]] of the U.S. Constitution.<ref>Procida, Lee.

Penalties for DUI vary by level of intoxication and number of previous convictions. A first offense DUI with a BAC level of less than 0.10% faces a fine of $250 to $400, an automobile insurance surcharge of $1000 per year for 3 years, 12 hours of alcohol education, a 3-month license suspension, and imprisonment for up to 30 days (rarely imposed).<ref name="NJ DWI Center"/> If the driver's BAC level is 0.10% or greater, the fine increases to $300 to $500, and the license suspension increase to 7 to 12 months. If the driver's BAC level is 0.15% or greater, the driver will be required to have an [[ignition interlock device]] installed in their car for 6 to 12 months after they have their license restored.<ref name="DWI Penalties"/>  New Jersey does not have [[Administrative License Revocation|administrative license revocation]], and thus a suspected drunk driver's license is not suspended until they are convicted.<ref name="IIHS"/>

A person under 21 who is convicted of driving with a BAC level of at least 0.01%, but less than 0.08% will have their driver's license suspended for 1 to 3 months, be required to perform 15–30 hours of community service, and take part in an alcohol education program. Penalties for refusal to submit a breath sample are the same as driving with a BAC over 0.15%. The holder of a [[commercial driver's license]] (CDL) is subject to a one-year suspension of their CDL for the first offense, and a lifetime CDL suspension for repeat offenses if they drive a commercial vehicle with a BAC of 0.04% or greater, drive an automobile with a BAC of 0.08% or greater, or refuse to submit a breath sample.<ref name="Commercial DWI"/> More severe penalties may be imposed if the DUI took place within 1000 feet of a school, or if there was a juvenile in the vehicle.<ref name="DWI Penalties"/> DUI accidents resulting in serious injury or death are considered [[indictment|indictable]] crimes.<ref name="NJ DWI Center"/>

New Jersey prohibits [[plea bargaining]] in DUI cases unless the prosecutor believes there is insufficient evidence to prove the case, and New Jersey does not offer hardship (work) licenses for people convicted of DUI.<ref name="DWI Report"/> Because DUI is not a criminal offense in New Jersey, defendants are ineligible for pretrial intervention (PTI) and other [[diversion program]]s.<ref name="DUI eluding">[http://www.avvo.com/legal-answers/if-i-accept-pti-on-a-second-degree-eluding-w--dui--1089638.html?ref=kb_serp_title_4 "If I accept PTI on a second degree eluding w/ DUI is it 100% mandatory that I lose my license for 6 months from the eluding"] on Avvo (blog) (24 January 2013).

For a second DUI conviction in a 10-year period, irrespective of BAC, there is a fine of $500–$1,000, 2–90 days imprisonment, a 2-year license suspension, an automobile insurance surcharge of $1,000 a year for 3 years, and installation of an ignition interlock device for 1 to 3 years after license restoration.

Social hosts are given more liability protection than licensed businesses in that a private person is generally only liable for the actions of guests over 21 if their blood alcohol content is above 0.15, and the lawsuit involves drunk driving injuries.<ref>Rossetti, Andrew J.

N.J.S.A. 2A:15-5.6 provides that a blood alcohol content (BAC) less than 0.10% results in an irrebuttable presumption that the person tested was not visibly intoxicated in the social host’s presence, thus relieving the social host from liability. If the guest's BAC is between 0.10%–0.15%, there is a rebuttable presumption that the driver was not visibly intoxicated in the social host’s presence. Nothing in this act limits the liability of social hosts who serve alcohol to people under 21.</ref> As long as a guest is not underage, a social host has no liability for assaults, falls, and other non-DUI injuries.<ref name="Chamlin"/> Although most alcohol-related lawsuits involve parties injured by drunk drivers, there have been cases in New Jersey where drunk drivers were able to successfully sue the establishment that served them.<ref>Associated Press.

Tranquillino'' the New Jersey courts held that a drunk driver can sue a bar or restaurant under the "Dram Shop Act" and prevail under the theory that:

<blockquote>"[a] person who sustains personal injury or property damage as a result of the negligent service of alcoholic beverages by a licensed alcoholic beverage server may recover damages from a licensed alcoholic beverage server if the server was negligent (i.e. served a visibly intoxicated person), the injury was proximately caused by the negligent service of alcoholic beverages, and the injury was a foreseeable consequence of the negligent service."<ref name="Voss"/></blockquote>

In 1959, the New Jersey Supreme Court permitted a lawsuit against several taverns that had served alcohol to an underage person, who then caused a fatal automobile accident. The court stated that its decision was based on the fact that this conduct was already illegal under ABC regulations, stating that, "We are convinced that recognition of the plaintiff's claim will afford a fairer measure of justice to innocent third parties whose injuries are brought about by the unlawful and negligent sale of alcoholic beverages to minors and intoxicated persons."<ref>[http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=195921931NJ188_1180.xml&docbase=CSLWAR1-1950-1985 ''Rappaport v.

Super. 391 (1992).</ref>

Because of complaints from bar owners about their inability to obtain liability insurance, the state passed legislation in 1987 to limit liability to cases where the server could have realistically known that the patron was underage or intoxicated, and to limit lawsuits to types of injuries that are foreseeable. The act also instituted the legal standard of comparative negligence in these cases, wherein the monetary damages against a licensed establishment can be reduced if there are others who are also [[negligent]] (e.g. the patron, other bars).<ref name="dram shop interpretation"/><ref>[http://law.njstatelib.org/law_files/njlh/lh1987/L1987c152.pdf P.L.1987 c.152]</ref> Additional legislation passed in 1987 substantially limited the liability of social hosts for adult guests.<ref name="social host liability"/>

The applicability of state and municipal alcohol laws on federal lands is a complex and partially unresolved legal issue that depends on whether the federal property is considered a [[federal enclave]], what rights the state reserved when it granted the property to the federal government, and whether the law is [[criminal law|criminal]] or [[civil law (common law)|civil]]. If the federal property is not an enclave, the federal government either has [[concurrent jurisdiction]] (shared authority with the state) or [[federal jurisdiction (United States)|proprietary jurisdiction]] (only the rights of a landowner), and the state can enforce alcohol laws.<ref name="enclaves">[http://federalenclaves.com/Staff.html Haines Jr., Roger W.

If the federal property is an enclave, then the federal government has [[exclusive jurisdiction]], unless the state reserved rights when it [[cession|ceded]] the land to the federal government.<ref name="enclaves"/> The [[Assimilative Crimes Act]] makes it a federal crime to violate a state law while at a federal enclave in that state.
