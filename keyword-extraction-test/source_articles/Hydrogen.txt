'''Hydrogen''' is a [[chemical element]] with [[chemical symbol]]&nbsp;'''H''' and [[atomic number]]&nbsp;1. With an [[atomic weight]] of {{val|1.00794|u=[[atomic mass unit|u]]}}, hydrogen is the lightest element on the [[periodic table]]. Its [[monatomic]] form (H) is the [[abundance of the chemical elements|most abundant]] chemical substance in the [[Universe]], constituting roughly 75% of all [[baryon]]ic mass.<ref>

See [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]].</ref> Non-[[stellar remnant|remnant]] [[star]]s are mainly composed of hydrogen in the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] state. The most common [[isotope]] of hydrogen, termed ''protium'' (name rarely used, symbol <sup>1</sup>H), has one [[proton]] and no [[neutron]]s.

The universal emergence of atomic hydrogen first occurred during the [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination epoch]]. At [[standard temperature and pressure]], hydrogen is a [[Transparency (optics)|colorless]], [[odorless]], [[taste]]less, non-toxic, [[nonmetal]]lic, highly [[combustion|combustible]] [[Diatomic molecule|diatomic]] [[gas]] with the [[molecular formula]] H<sub>2</sub>. Since hydrogen readily forms [[covalent bond|covalent]] compounds with most nonmetallic elements, most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in [[Molecular geometry|molecular forms]] such as [[water]] or [[organic compound]]s. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in [[acid–base reaction]]s because most acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In [[ionic compound]]s, hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge (i.e., [[anion]]) when it is known as a [[hydride]], or as a positively charged (i.e., [[cation]]) [[chemical species|species]] denoted by the symbol H<sup>+</sup>.

The [[ground state]] [[energy level]] of the electron in a hydrogen atom is -13.6&nbsp;[[Electronvolt|eV]],<ref>{{cite web|author1=NAAP Labs|title=Energy Levels|url=http://astro.unl.edu/naap/hydrogen/levels.html|publisher=University of Nebraska Lincoln|accessdate=20 May 2015|date=2009}}</ref> which is equivalent to an ultraviolet [[photon]] of roughly 91&nbsp;[[metre|nm]] wavelength.<ref>{{cite web

The energy levels of hydrogen can be calculated fairly accurately using the [[Bohr model]] of the atom, which conceptualizes the electron as "orbiting" the proton in analogy to the Earth's orbit of the Sun. However, the atomic electron and proton are held together by [[electromagnetic force]], while planets and celestial objects are held by [[gravity]]. Because of the discretization of [[angular momentum]] postulated in early [[quantum mechanics]] by Bohr, the electron in the Bohr model can only occupy certain allowed distances from the proton, and therefore only certain allowed energies.<ref>{{cite web

A more accurate description of the hydrogen atom comes from a purely quantum mechanical treatment that uses the [[Schrödinger equation]], [[Dirac equation]] or even the [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]] [[path integral formulation]] to calculate the [[probability amplitude|probability density]] of the electron around the proton.<ref>{{cite web| last=Stern|first=D.

In the quantum mechanical treatment, the electron in a ground state hydrogen atom has no angular momentum at all—illustrating how the "planetary orbit" differs from electron motion.

While H<sub>2</sub> is not very reactive under standard conditions, it does form compounds with most elements.

Hydrogen forms a vast array of compounds with [[carbon]] called the [[hydrocarbon]]s, and an even vaster array with [[heteroatoms]] that, because of their general association with living things, are called [[organic compound]]s.<ref name="hydrocarbon">{{cite web| title=Structure and Nomenclature of Hydrocarbons|publisher=Purdue University| url=http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/topicreview/bp/1organic/organic.html| accessdate=23 March 2008}}</ref> The study of their properties is known as [[organic chemistry]]<ref>{{cite web| title=Organic Chemistry| work=Dictionary.com| publisher=Lexico Publishing Group| date=2008| url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/organic%20chemistry| accessdate=23 March 2008}}</ref> and their study in the context of living [[organism]]s is known as [[biochemistry]].<ref>{{cite web

|publisher=Lexico Publishing Group

|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/biochemistry
|accessdate=23 March 2008}}</ref> By some definitions, "organic" compounds are only required to contain carbon. However, most of them also contain hydrogen, and because it is the carbon-hydrogen bond which gives this class of compounds most of its particular chemical characteristics, carbon-hydrogen bonds are required in some definitions of the word "organic" in chemistry.<ref name="hydrocarbon" /> Millions of [[hydrocarbon]]s are known, and they are usually formed by complicated synthetic pathways that seldom involve elementary hydrogen.

====Hydrides====
{{Main|Hydride}}
Compounds of hydrogen are often called [[hydride]]s, a term that is used fairly loosely. The term "hydride" suggests that the H atom has acquired a negative or anionic character, denoted H<sup>-</sup>, and is used when hydrogen forms a compound with a more [[electropositive]] element. The existence of the [[hydride|hydride anion]], suggested by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] in 1916 for group 1 and 2 salt-like hydrides, was demonstrated by Moers in 1920 by the electrolysis of molten [[lithium hydride]] (LiH), producing a [[stoichiometric|stoichiometry]] quantity of hydrogen at the anode.<ref name="Moers">{{cite journal
|last=Moers|first=K.

|date=1920|volume=113|issue=191|pages=179–228|doi=10.1002/zaac.19201130116
}}</ref> For hydrides other than group 1 and 2 metals, the term is quite misleading, considering the low electronegativity of hydrogen. An exception in group 2 hydrides is {{chem|BeH|2}}, which is polymeric. In [[lithium aluminium hydride]], the {{chem|AlH|4|-}} anion carries hydridic centers firmly attached to the Al(III).

Although hydrides can be formed with almost all main-group elements, the number and combination of possible compounds varies widely; for example, more than 100 binary borane hydrides are known, but only one binary aluminium hydride.<ref name="Downs">{{cite journal

In [[inorganic chemistry]], hydrides can also serve as [[bridging ligand]]s that link two metal centers in a [[coordination complex]]. This function is particularly common in [[group 13 element]]s, especially in [[borane]]s ([[boron]] hydrides) and [[aluminium]] complexes, as well as in clustered [[carborane]]s.<ref name="Miessler" />

====Protons and acids====
{{Further|Acid–base reaction}}
Oxidation of hydrogen removes its electron and gives [[Hydrogen ion|H<sup>+</sup>]], which contains no electrons and a [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] which is usually composed of one proton. That is why {{chem|H|+}} is often called a proton. This species is central to discussion of [[acid]]s. Under the [[Bronsted-Lowry theory]], acids are proton donors, while bases are proton acceptors.

A bare proton, {{chem|H|+}}, cannot exist in solution or in ionic crystals because of its unstoppable attraction to other atoms or molecules with electrons. Except at the high temperatures associated with plasmas, such protons cannot be removed from the [[electron cloud]]s of atoms and molecules, and will remain attached to them. However, the term 'proton' is sometimes used loosely and metaphorically to refer to positively charged or [[cation]]ic hydrogen attached to other species in this fashion, and as such is denoted "{{chem|H|+}}" without any implication that any single protons exist freely as a species.

To avoid the implication of the naked "solvated proton" in solution, acidic aqueous solutions are sometimes considered to contain a less unlikely fictitious species, termed the "[[hydronium]] ion" ({{chem|H|3|O|+}}). However, even in this case, such solvated hydrogen cations are more realistically conceived as being organized into clusters that form species closer to H{{su|b=9}}{{chem|O|4|+}}.<ref name="Okumura">{{cite journal

Hydrogen is the only element that has different names for its isotopes in common use today. During the early study of radioactivity, various heavy radioactive isotopes were given their own names, but such names are no longer used, except for deuterium and tritium. The symbols D and T (instead of {{chem|2|H}} and {{chem|3|H}}) are sometimes used for deuterium and tritium, but the corresponding symbol for protium, P, is already in use for [[phosphorus]] and thus is not available for protium.<ref>{{cite web

[[File:Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier (by Louis Jean Desire Delaistre)RENEW.jpg|thumb|180px|Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier]]
Lavoisier produced hydrogen for his experiments on mass conservation by reacting a flux of steam with metallic [[iron]] through an incandescent iron tube heated in a fire. Anaerobic oxidation of iron by the protons of water at high temperature can be schematically represented by the set of following reactions:

:&nbsp;&nbsp; Fe + &nbsp;&nbsp; H<sub>2</sub>O ? FeO + H<sub>2</sub>

:2 Fe + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O ? Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>

:3 Fe + 4 H<sub>2</sub>O ? Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + 4 H<sub>2</sub>

Many metals such as [[zirconium]] undergo a similar reaction with water leading to the production of hydrogen.

Hydrogen was [[Liquid hydrogen|liquefied]] for the first time by [[James Dewar]] in 1898 by using [[regenerative cooling]] and his invention, the [[vacuum flask]].<ref name="nbb" /> He produced [[solid hydrogen]] the next year.<ref name="nbb" /> [[Deuterium]] was discovered in December 1931 by [[Harold Urey]], and [[tritium]] was prepared in 1934 by [[Ernest Rutherford]], [[Mark Oliphant]], and [[Paul Harteck]].<ref name="Nostrand" /> [[Heavy water]], which consists of deuterium in the place of regular hydrogen, was discovered by Urey's group in 1932.<ref name="nbb" /> [[François Isaac de Rivaz]] built the first [[de Rivaz engine]], an internal combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806. [[Edward Daniel Clarke]] invented the hydrogen gas blowpipe in 1819. The [[Döbereiner's lamp]] and [[limelight]] were invented in 1823.<ref name="nbb" />

The first hydrogen-filled [[balloon]] was invented by [[Jacques Charles]] in 1783.<ref name="nbb" /> Hydrogen provided the lift for the first reliable form of air-travel following the 1852 invention of the first hydrogen-lifted airship by [[Henri Giffard]].<ref name="nbb" /> German count [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin]] promoted the idea of rigid airships lifted by hydrogen that later were called [[Zeppelin]]s; the first of which had its maiden flight in 1900.<ref name="nbb" /> Regularly scheduled flights started in 1910 and by the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, they had carried 35,000 passengers without a serious incident. Hydrogen-lifted airships were used as observation platforms and bombers during the war.

The first non-stop transatlantic crossing was made by the British airship ''[[R34 (airship)|R34]]'' in 1919. Regular passenger service resumed in the 1920s and the discovery of [[helium]] reserves in the United States promised increased safety, but the U.S. government refused to sell the gas for this purpose. Therefore, H<sub>2</sub> was used in the [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|''Hindenburg'']] airship, which was destroyed in a midair fire over [[New Jersey]] on 6 May 1937.<ref name="nbb" /> The incident was broadcast live on radio and filmed. Ignition of leaking hydrogen is widely assumed to be the cause, but later investigations pointed to the ignition of the [[aluminium|aluminized]] fabric coating by [[static electricity]]. But the damage to hydrogen's reputation as a [[lifting gas]] was already done.

In the same year the first [[hydrogen-cooled turbogenerator]] went into service with gaseous hydrogen as a [[coolant]] in the rotor and the stator in 1937 at [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], Ohio, by the Dayton Power & Light Co.;<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/chronologicalhis00natirich/chronologicalhis00natirich_djvu.txt|title=A chronological history of electrical development from 600 B.C|author=National Electrical Manufacturers Association|year=1946|page=102}}</ref> because of the thermal conductivity of hydrogen gas, this is the most common type in its field today.

One of the first quantum effects to be explicitly noticed (but not understood at the time) was a Maxwell observation involving hydrogen, half a century before full [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical theory]] arrived. Maxwell observed that the [[specific heat capacity]] of H<sub>2</sub> unaccountably departs from that of a [[diatomic]] gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures. According to quantum theory, this behavior arises from the spacing of the (quantized) rotational energy levels, which are particularly wide-spaced in H<sub>2</sub> because of its low mass. These widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures. Diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect.<ref name="Berman">{{cite journal

Throughout the universe, hydrogen is mostly found in the [[atom]]ic and [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] states, with properties quite different from those of molecular hydrogen. As a plasma, hydrogen's electron and proton are not bound together, resulting in very high electrical conductivity and high emissivity (producing the light from the Sun and other stars). The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the [[solar wind]] they interact with the Earth's [[magnetosphere]] giving rise to [[Birkeland current]]s and the [[Aurora (phenomenon)|aurora]]. Hydrogen is found in the neutral atomic state in the [[interstellar medium]]. The large amount of neutral hydrogen found in the damped Lyman-alpha systems is thought to dominate the cosmological baryonic density of the Universe up to [[redshift]] ''z''=4.<ref>{{cite journal

== Production ==
{{main|Hydrogen production}}

{{chem|H|2}} is produced in chemistry and biology laboratories, often as a by-product of other reactions; in industry for the [[hydrogenation]] of [[Saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] substrates; and in nature as a means of expelling [[redox|reducing]] equivalents in biochemical reactions.

=== Steam reforming ===

Hydrogen can be prepared in several different ways, but economically the most important processes involve removal of hydrogen from hydrocarbons, as about 95% of hydrogen production came from steam reforming around year 2000.<ref name="Ogden 1999">{{cite journal |last=Ogden |first=J.M. |title=Prospects for building a hydrogen energy infrastructure |journal=Annual Review of Energy and the Environment |year=1999 |volume=24 |pages=227–279 |doi=10.1146/annurev.energy.24.1.227}}</ref><!--update?--> Commercial bulk hydrogen is usually produced by the [[steam reforming]] of [[natural gas]].<ref name="Oxtoby">{{cite book

: {{chem|CH|4}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} ? CO + 3 {{chem|H|2}}

This reaction is favored at low pressures but is nonetheless conducted at high pressures (2.0 &nbsp;MPa, 20&nbsp;atm or 600&nbsp;[[inHg]]). This is because high-pressure {{chem|H|2}} is the most marketable product and [[Pressure Swing Adsorption]] (PSA) purification systems work better at higher pressures. The product mixture is known as "[[synthesis gas]]" because it is often used directly for the production of [[methanol]] and related compounds. [[Hydrocarbon]]s other than methane can be used to produce synthesis gas with varying product ratios. One of the many complications to this highly optimized technology is the formation of coke or carbon:

: {{chem|CH|4}} ? C + 2 {{chem|H|2}}

Consequently, steam reforming typically employs an excess of {{chem|H|2|O}}. Additional hydrogen can be recovered from the steam by use of carbon monoxide through the [[water gas shift reaction]], especially with an [[iron oxide]] catalyst. This reaction is also a common industrial source of [[carbon dioxide]]:<ref name="Oxtoby" />

: CO + {{chem|H|2|O}} ? {{chem|CO|2}} + {{chem|H|2}}

Other important methods for {{chem|H|2}} production include partial oxidation of hydrocarbons:<ref>{{cite web| title=Hydrogen Properties, Uses, Applications| publisher=Universal Industrial Gases, Inc.| date=2007| url=http://www.uigi.com/hydrogen.html| accessdate=11 March 2008}}</ref>

and the coal reaction, which can serve as a prelude to the shift reaction above:<ref name="Oxtoby" />

: C + {{chem|H|2|O}} ? CO + {{chem|H|2}}

Hydrogen is sometimes produced and consumed in the same industrial process, without being separated.

In the [[laboratory]], {{chem|H|2}} is usually prepared by the reaction of dilute [[oxidizing acid|non-oxidizing acids]] on some reactive metals such as [[zinc]] with [[Kipp's apparatus]].

: Zn + 2 {{chem|H|+}} ? {{chem|Zn|2+}} + {{chem|H|2}}

[[Aluminium]] can also produce {{chem|H|2}} upon treatment with bases:

: 2 Al + 6 {{chem|H|2|O}} + 2 {{chem|OH|-}} ? 2 {{chem|Al(OH)|4|-}} + 3 {{chem|H|2}}

The [[electrolysis of water]] is a simple method of producing hydrogen. A low voltage current is run through the water, and gaseous oxygen forms at the [[anode]] while gaseous hydrogen forms at the [[cathode]]. Typically the cathode is made from platinum or another inert metal when producing hydrogen for storage. If, however, the gas is to be burnt on site, oxygen is desirable to assist the combustion, and so both electrodes would be made from inert metals. (Iron, for instance, would oxidize, and thus decrease the amount of oxygen given off.) The theoretical maximum efficiency (electricity used vs. energetic value of hydrogen produced) is in the range 80–94%.<ref>{{cite web

An alloy of aluminium and [[gallium]] in pellet form added to water can be used to generate hydrogen. The process also produces [[alumina]], but the expensive gallium, which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used. This has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy, as hydrogen can be produced on-site and does not need to be transported.<ref>{{cite web| last=Venere|first=E.|date=15 May 2007| url=http://news.uns.purdue.edu/x/2007a/070515WoodallHydrogen.html| title=New process generates hydrogen from aluminum alloy to run engines, fuel cells| publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=5 February 2008}}</ref>

=== Thermochemical ===

There are more than 200 thermochemical cycles which can be used for [[water splitting]], around a dozen of these cycles such as the [[iron oxide cycle]], [[cerium(IV) oxide–cerium(III) oxide cycle]], [[zinc zinc-oxide cycle]], [[sulfur-iodine cycle]], [[copper-chlorine cycle]] and [[hybrid sulfur cycle]] are under research and in testing phase to produce hydrogen and oxygen from water and heat without using electricity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review05/pd28_weimer.pdf|title=Development of solar-powered thermochemical production of hydrogen from water|format=PDF|first1=Al|last1=Weimer|date=25 May 2005|publisher=Solar Thermochemical Hydrogen Generation Project}}</ref> A number of laboratories (including in France, Germany, Greece, Japan, and the USA) are developing thermochemical methods to produce hydrogen from solar energy and water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/progress07/ii_f_1_perret.pdf|title=Development of Solar-Powered Thermochemical Production of Hydrogen from Water, DOE Hydrogen Program, 2007|author=Perret, R.|accessdate=17 May 2008|format=PDF}}</ref>

=== Anaerobic corrosion ===

Under anaerobic conditions, [[iron]] and [[steel alloy]]s are slowly oxidized by the protons of water concomitantly reduced in molecular hydrogen ({{chem|H|2}}). The [[anaerobic corrosion]] of iron leads first to the formation of [[ferrous hydroxide]] (green rust) and can be described by the following reaction:

: Fe + 2 {{chem|H|2}}O ? {{chem|Fe(OH)|2}} + {{chem|H|2}}

In its turn, under anaerobic conditions, the [[ferrous hydroxide]] ({{chem|Fe(OH)|2}} ) can be oxidized by the protons of water to form [[magnetite]] and molecular hydrogen.
This process is described by the [[Schikorr reaction]]:

: 3 {{chem|Fe(OH)|2}} ? {{chem|Fe|3|O|4|}} + 2 {{chem|H|2}}O + {{chem|H|2}}
: ''ferrous hydroxide ? magnetite + water + hydrogen''

The well crystallized magnetite ({{chem|Fe|3|O|4|}}) is thermodynamically more stable than the ferrous hydroxide ({{chem|Fe(OH)|2}} ).

This process occurs during the anaerobic corrosion of [[iron]] and [[steel]] in [[Anoxic waters|oxygen-free]] [[groundwater]] and in reducing [[soil]]s below the [[water table]].

=== Geological occurrence: the serpentinization reaction ===

In the absence of atmospheric oxygen ({{chem|O|2}}), in deep geological conditions prevailing far away from Earth atmosphere, hydrogen ({{chem|H|2}}) is produced during the process of [[Serpentinization#Hydrogen production by anaerobic oxidation of fayalite ferrous ions|serpentinization]] by the anaerobic oxidation by the water protons (H<sup>+</sup>) of the ferrous (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) silicate present in the crystal lattice of the [[fayalite]] ({{chem|Fe|2|SiO|4}}, the [[olivine]] iron-endmember). The corresponding reaction leading to the formation of [[magnetite]] ({{chem|Fe|3|O|4|}}), [[quartz]] (Si{{chem|O|2}}) and hydrogen ({{chem|H|2}}) is the following:

: 3{{chem|Fe|2|SiO|4}} + 2 {{chem|H|2}}O ? 2 {{chem|Fe|3|O|4|}} + 3 Si{{chem|O|2}} + 3 {{chem|H|2}}
: ''fayalite + water ? magnetite + quartz + hydrogen''

This reaction closely resembles the [[Schikorr reaction]] observed in the anaerobic oxidation of the [[ferrous hydroxide]] in contact with water.

=== Formation in transformers ===

From all the fault gases formed in power [[transformer]]s, hydrogen is the most common and is generated under most fault conditions; thus, formation of hydrogen is an early indication of serious problems in the transformer's life cycle.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hirschler, M.

==Applications==

===Consumption in processes===
Large quantities of {{chem|H|2}} are needed in the petroleum and chemical industries. The largest application of {{chem|H|2}} is for the processing ("upgrading") of fossil fuels, and in the production of [[ammonia]]. The key consumers of {{chem|H|2}} in the petrochemical plant include [[hydrodealkylation]], [[hydrodesulfurization]], and [[hydrocracking]]. {{chem|H|2}} has several other important uses. {{chem|H|2}} is used as a hydrogenating agent, particularly in increasing the level of saturation of unsaturated fats and [[Vegetable oil|oils]] (found in items such as margarine), and in the production of [[methanol]]. It is similarly the source of hydrogen in the manufacture of [[hydrochloric acid]]. {{chem|H|2}} is also used as a [[reducing agent]] of metallic [[ore]]s.<ref>{{cite web

Even interpreting the hydrogen data (including safety data) is confounded by a number of phenomena. Many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen depend on the [[Spin isomers of hydrogen|parahydrogen/orthohydrogen]] ratio (it often takes days or weeks at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio, for which the data is usually given). Hydrogen detonation parameters, such as critical detonation pressure and temperature, strongly depend on the container geometry.<ref name=NASAH2/>
