The '''Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major''' by [[Gustav Mahler]] is one of the largest-scale choral works in the classical concert repertoire. Because it requires huge instrumental and vocal forces it is frequently called the "'''Symphony of a Thousand'''", although the work is normally presented with far fewer than a thousand performers and the composer did not sanction that name. The work was composed in a single inspired burst, at [[Maiernigg]] in southern Austria in the summer of 1906. The last of Mahler's works that was premiered in his lifetime, the [[symphony]] was a critical and popular success when he conducted its first performance in Munich on 12&nbsp;September 1910.

The fusion of song and symphony had been a characteristic of Mahler's early works. In his "middle" compositional period after 1901, a change of direction led him to produce three purely instrumental symphonies. The Eighth, marking the end of the middle period, returns to a combination of orchestra and voice in a symphonic context. The structure of the work is unconventional; instead of the normal framework of several movements, the piece is in two parts. Part&nbsp;I is based on the Latin text of a 9th-century Christian hymn for Pentecost, ''[[Veni creator spiritus]]'' ("Come, Creator Spirit"), and Part&nbsp;II is a setting of the words from the closing scene of [[Goethe's Faust|Goethe's ''Faust'']]. The two parts are unified by a common idea, that of [[Salvation#Redemption|redemption]] through the power of love, a unity conveyed through shared musical themes.

Mahler had been convinced from the start of the work's significance; in renouncing the pessimism that had marked much of his music, he offered the Eighth as an expression of confidence in the eternal human spirit. In the period following the composer's death, performances were comparatively rare. However, from the mid-20th century onwards the symphony has been heard regularly in concert halls all over the world, and has been recorded many times. While recognising its wide popularity, modern critics have divided opinions on the work; [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Robert Simpson (composer)|Robert Simpson]] and [[Jonathan Carr]] found its optimism unconvincing, and considered it artistically and musically inferior to Mahler's other symphonies. Conversely, it has also been compared—by [[Deryck Cooke]]—to [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] as a defining human statement for its century.

==History==

===Background===
[[File:Photo of Gustav Mahler by Moritz Nähr 02.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt= Middle-aged man, seated, facing towards the left with head turned towards the right. He has a high forehead and rimless glasses, and is wearing a dark, crumpled suit|Gustav Mahler in 1907]]
By the summer of 1906, Mahler had been director of the [[Vienna State Opera|Vienna Hofoper]] for nine years.{{#tag:ref|Mahler had joined the Hofoper as a staff conductor in April 1897, and had succeeded [[Wilhelm Jahn]] as director in October of that year.<ref>Carr, p. 86</ref>|group= n}} Throughout this time his practice was to leave Vienna at the close of the Hofoper season for a summer retreat, where he could devote himself to composition. Since 1899 this haven had been at Maiernigg, near the resort town of [[Maria Wörth]] in [[Carinthia]], southern Austria, where Mahler built a villa overlooking the [[Wörthersee]].<ref>Blaukopf, p. 137</ref> In these restful surroundings Mahler completed his [[Symphony No. 4 (Mahler)|Fourth]], [[Symphony No. 5 (Mahler)|Fifth]], [[Symphony No. 6 (Mahler)|Sixth]] and [[Symphony No. 7 (Mahler)|Seventh]] symphonies, his [[Rückert-Lieder|Rückert songs]] and his song cycle ''[[Kindertotenlieder]]'' ("Songs on the Death of Children").<ref>Blaukopf, pp. 158, 165, 203</ref>

Until 1901, Mahler's compositions had been heavily influenced by the German folk-poem collection ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'' ("The Youth's Magic Horn"), which he had first encountered around 1887.<ref name= Franklin4>{{cite web|last= Franklin|first= Peter|editor-first= Laura |editor-last= Macy|title= Mahler, Gustav|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/|publisher= Oxford Music Online |year= 2007|accessdate= 21 February 2010}} (4. Prague 1885–86 and Leipzig 1886–88)</ref> The music of Mahler's many ''Wunderhorn'' settings is reflected in his [[Symphony No. 2 (Mahler)|Second]], [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Third]] and Fourth symphonies, which all employ vocal as well as instrumental forces. From about 1901, however, Mahler's music underwent a change in character as he moved into the middle period of his compositional life.<ref name= Cooke71>Cooke, p. 71</ref> Here, the more austere poems of [[Friedrich Rückert]] replace the ''Wunderhorn'' collection as the primary influence; the songs are less folk-related, and no longer infiltrate the symphonies as extensively as before.<ref name= Mitch32>Mitchell, Vol. II p. 32</ref> During this period the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Symphonies were written, all as purely instrumental works, portrayed by Mahler scholar [[Deryck Cooke]] as "more stern and forthright&nbsp;..., more tautly symphonic, with a new granite-like hardness of [[orchestration]]".<ref name= Cooke71 />

Mahler arrived at Maiernigg in June 1906 with the draft manuscript of his Seventh Symphony; he intended to spend time revising the orchestration until an idea for a new work should strike.<ref name= DLG426>La Grange (2000), pp. 426–27</ref> The composer's wife [[Alma Mahler]], in her memoirs, says that for a fortnight Mahler was "haunted by the spectre of failing inspiration";<ref>A. Mahler, p. 102</ref> Mahler's recollection, however, is that on the first day of the vacation he was seized by the creative spirit, and plunged immediately into composition of the work that would become his Eighth Symphony.<ref name= DLG426 /><ref name= AM328>A. Mahler, p. 328</ref>

===Composition===
Two notes in Mahler's handwriting dating from June 1906 show that early schemes for the work, which he may not at first have intended as a fully choral symphony, were based on a four-movement structure in which two "hymns" surround an instrumental core.<ref name= DLG889>La Grange (2000), p. 889</ref> These outlines show that Mahler had fixed on the idea of opening with the Latin hymn, but had not yet settled on the precise form of the rest. The first note is as follows:

# Hymn: ''Veni Creator''
# Scherzo
# Adagio: ''Caritas'' ("Christian love")
# Hymn: ''Die Geburt des Eros'' ("The birth of Eros")<ref name= DLG889 />

The second note includes musical sketches for the ''Veni creator'' movement, and two [[Bar (music)|bars]] in [[B minor]] which are thought to relate to the ''Caritas''. The four-movement plan is retained in a slightly different form, still without specific indication of the extent of the choral element:

# ''Veni creator''
# ''Caritas''
# ''Weihnachtsspiele mit dem Kindlein'' ("Christmas games with the child")
# ''Schöpfung durch Eros. Hymne'' ("Creation through Eros. Hymn")<ref name= DLG889 />

[[File:Mahler Composition Hut Klagenfurt.jpg|thumb|alt= A small grey hut, surrounded by woods, with an open door to which is affixed a picture of the composer|Mahler's composing hut at Maiernigg, where the Eighth Symphony was composed in summer 1906]]

From Mahler's later comments on the symphony's gestation, it is evident that the four-movement plan was relatively short-lived. He soon replaced the last three movements with a single section, essentially a dramatic [[cantata]], based on the closing scenes of Goethe's ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'', the depiction of an ideal of redemption through eternal womanhood (''das Ewige-Weibliche'').<ref>Kennedy, p. 77</ref> Mahler had long nurtured an ambition to set the end of the ''Faust'' epic to music, "and to set it quite differently from other composers who have made it saccharine and feeble."<ref name= Mitch519>Mitchell, Vol. III p. 519</ref>  In comments recorded by his biographer [[Richard Specht]], Mahler makes no mention of the original four-movement plans. He told Specht that having chanced on the ''Veni creator'' hymn, he had a sudden vision of the complete work: "I saw the whole piece immediately before my eyes, and only needed to write it down as though it were being dictated to me."<ref name= Mitch519 />

The work was written at a frantic pace—"in record time", according to the musicologist [[Henry-Louis de La Grange]].<ref name= DLG890>La Grange (2000), p. 890</ref> It was completed in all its essentials by mid-August, even though Mahler had to absent himself for a week to attend the [[Salzburg Festival]].<ref>Kennedy, p. 149</ref><ref>La Grange (2000), pp. 432–47</ref> Mahler began composing the ''Veni creator'' hymn without waiting for the text to arrive from Vienna. When it did, according to Alma Mahler, "the complete text fitted the music exactly. Intuitively he had composed the music for the full strophes [verses]."{{#tag:ref|Mitchell adds a caveat to this recollection: ''as far as he had carried the composition of the hymn at the time when the text arrived.'' Given the scale of the movement and its complexity, the suggestion that it was composed in its entirety in advance of the words is, in Mitchell's view, impossible to accept.<ref name=Mitch523 />|group= n}} Although amendments and alterations were subsequently carried out to the score, there is very little manuscript evidence of the sweeping changes and rewriting that occurred with his earlier symphonies as they were prepared for performance.<ref name= Mitch523>Mitchell, Vol. III pp. 523–25</ref>

With its use of vocal elements throughout, rather than in episodes at or near the end, the work was the first completely choral symphony to be written.<ref name= K151>Kennedy, p. 151</ref> Mahler had no doubts about the ground-breaking nature of the symphony, calling it the grandest thing he had ever done, and maintaining that all his previous symphonies were merely preludes to it. "Try to imagine the whole universe beginning to ring and resound. There are no longer human voices, but planets and suns revolving." It was his "gift to the nation&nbsp;... a great joy-bringer."<ref>La Grange (2000), p. 926</ref>

===Instrumental and vocal forces===

====Orchestra====
The symphony is scored for a very large orchestra, in keeping with Mahler's conception of the work as a "new symphonic universe", a synthesis of symphony, cantata, [[oratorio]], [[motet]], and [[lied]] in a combination of styles. La Grange comments: "To give expression to his cosmic vision, it was&nbsp;... necessary to go beyond all previously known limits and dimensions."<ref name= DLG890 /> The orchestral forces required are, however, not as large as those deployed in [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s oratorio ''[[Gurre-Lieder]]'', completed in 1911.<ref name= DLG910>La Grange (2000), p. 910</ref> The string section is conventional in that it contains [[violin]]s divided, [[viola]]s, [[cello]]s, and [[double bass]]es. The woodwind section for the Eighth includes two [[piccolo]]s (one doubling 5th flute), four [[flute]]s, four [[oboe]]s, a [[cor anglais]], three B-flat [[clarinet]]s, at least two [[E-flat clarinet]]s, a B-flat [[bass clarinet]], four [[bassoon]]s and a [[contrabassoon]]. The brass section requires eight [[French horn|horns]], four [[trumpet]]s, four [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]] and a "separately placed" ensemble of four trumpets (the first of which may be doubled) and three trombones. The percussion forces consist of [[timpani]], [[cymbal]]s, [[bass drum]], [[tamtam]], [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] and low-pitched [[tubular bell|bells]]. Mahler also added a [[glockenspiel]] during the final rehearsals. Other instruments include an [[Organ (music)|organ]], a [[harmonium]], a [[piano]] (also added during the rehearsals), two [[harp]]s (although at least four are preferred), a [[celesta]], and at least one [[mandolin]] (but preferably several). Mahler recommended that in very large halls, the first player in each of the woodwind sections should be doubled and that numbers in the strings should also be augmented.<ref name= DLG910 /><ref name= UE>{{cite web|title= Gustav Mahler 8 Symphonie|url= http://www.universaledition.com/Gustav-Mahler/composers-and-works/composer/448/work/954|publisher= Universal Edition|accessdate= 16 May 2010}}</ref>

====Choral and vocal forces====

The choral and vocal forces consist of two [[SATB]] choirs, a children's choir, and eight soloists: three [[soprano]], two [[alto]], [[tenor]], [[baritone]], and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]]. In Part&nbsp;II the soloists are assigned to dramatic roles represented in Goethe's text, as illustrated in the following table.<ref>Mitchell, Vol. III pp. 552–567</ref>

La Grange draws attention to the notably high [[tessitura]] for the sopranos, for soloists and for choral singers. He characterises the alto solos as brief and unremarkable; however, the tenor solo role in Part&nbsp;II is both extensive and demanding, requiring on several occasions to be heard over the choruses. The wide melodic leaps in the Pater Profundus role present particular challenges to the bass soloist.<ref name= DLG910 />

===Reception and performance history===

====Premiere====

The building was not used for the 100th anniversary concerts, in October 2010, due to the logistical problems of moving the museum's transport exhibits.]]
Mahler made arrangements with the impresario Emil Gutmann for the symphony to be premiered in Munich in the autumn of 1910. He soon regretted this involvement, writing of his fears that Gutmann would turn the performance into "a catastrophic Barnum and Bailey show".<ref name= Blaukopf229>Blaukopf, pp. 229–32</ref> Preparations began early in the year, with the selection of choirs from the choral societies of Munich, Leipzig and Vienna. The Munich ''Zentral-Singschule'' provided 350 students for the children's choir. Meanwhile, [[Bruno Walter]], Mahler's assistant at the Vienna Hofoper, was responsible for the recruitment and preparation of the eight soloists. Through the spring and summer these forces prepared in their home towns, before assembling in Munich early in September for three full days of final rehearsals under Mahler.<ref name= Blaukopf229 /><ref name= Carr206>Carr, pp. 206–07</ref> His youthful assistant [[Otto Klemperer]] remarked later on the many small changes that Mahler made to the score during rehearsal: "He always wanted more clarity, more sound, more dynamic contrast. At one point during rehearsals he turned to us and said, 'If, after my death, something doesn't sound right, then change it. You have not only a right but a duty to do so.'"<ref>Heyworth, p. 48</ref>

For the premiere, fixed for 12 September, Gutmann had hired the newly built Neue Musik-Festhalle, in the Munich International Exhibition grounds near Theresienhöhe (now a branch of the [[Deutsches Museum]]). This vast hall had a capacity of 3,200; to assist ticket sales and raise publicity, Gutmann devised the nickname "Symphony of a Thousand", which has remained the symphony's popular subtitle despite Mahler's disapproval.<ref name= Carr206 />{{#tag:ref|It is not in fact certain that more than 1,000 performers participated in the Munich premiere. La Grange enumerates a chorus of 850 (including 350 children), 157 instrumentalists and the eight soloists, to give a total of 1,015. However, Jonathan Carr suggests that there is evidence that not all the Viennese choristers reached the hall and the number of performers may therefore not have reached 1,000.<ref name= Carr206 />|group= n}} Among the many distinguished figures present at the sold-out premiere were the composers [[Richard Strauss]], [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] and [[Anton Webern]]; the writers [[Thomas Mann]] and [[Arthur Schnitzler]]; and the leading theatre director of the day, [[Max Reinhardt]].<ref name= BBCarticle>{{cite web|title= Gustav Mahler: Eighth Symphony: Part One |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A66568963|publisher= British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)|accessdate= 6 May 2016}}</ref><ref name= Carr206 /> Also in the audience was the 28-year-old British conductor [[Leopold Stokowski]], who six years later would lead the first United States performance of the symphony.<ref name= Gibbs>{{cite web|last= Gibbs|first= Christopher H.|title= Mahler Symphony No. 8, "Symphony of a Thousand" |url= http://www.carnegiehall.org/Article.aspx?id=4294967687|publisher=  Carnegie Hall|year= 2010|accessdate= 6 May 2016}}</ref><ref name=NYTimes/>

Up to this time, receptions of Mahler's new symphonies had usually been disappointing.<ref name= BBCarticle/> However, the Munich premiere of the Eighth Symphony was an unqualified triumph; as the final chords died away there was a short pause before a huge outbreak of applause which lasted for twenty minutes.<ref name= BBCarticle/> Back at his hotel Mahler received a letter from Thomas Mann, which referred to the composer as "the man who, as I believe, expresses the art of our time in its profoundest and most sacred form".<ref>A. Mahler, p. 342</ref>

The symphony's duration at its first performance was recorded by the critic-composer [[Julius Korngold]] as 85 minutes.<ref>La Grange (2000), pp. 913 and 918</ref>{{#tag:ref|The symphony's publishers, Universal Editions, give the duration as 90 minutes,<ref name= UE /> as does Mahler's biographer Kurt Blaukopf.<ref>Blaukopf, p. 211</ref> Critic Michael Kennedy, however, estimates "roughly seventy-seven minutes".<ref name= Kennedy152 /> A typical modern recording, the 1995 Deutsche Grammophon version under [[Claudio Abbado]], plays for 81 minutes 20 seconds.<ref name= DG/>|group= n}} This performance was the last time that Mahler conducted a premiere of one of his own works. Eight months after his Munich triumph, he died at the age of 50. His remaining works—''[[Das Lied von der Erde]]'' ("The Song of the Earth"), his [[Symphony No. 9 (Mahler)|Ninth Symphony]] and the unfinished [[Symphony No. 10 (Mahler)|Tenth]]—were all premiered after his death.<ref name= Gibbs />

During the next three years, according to the calculations of Mahler's friend [[Guido Adler]] the Eighth Symphony received a further 20 performances across Europe.<ref>Carr, p. 222</ref> These included the Dutch premiere, in Amsterdam under [[Willem Mengelberg]] on 12&nbsp;March 1912,<ref name= Anderson /> and the first Prague performance, given on 20&nbsp;March 1912 under Mahler's former Vienna Hofoper colleague, [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Gustav Mahler: Works|publisher= Gustav Mahler 2010|url= http://www.gustavmahler2010.eu/Mahler-Dilo.aspx|year= 2010|accessdate= 9 May 2010}}</ref> Vienna itself had to wait until 1918 before the symphony was heard there.<ref name= Blaukopf229 /> In the US, Leopold Stokowski persuaded an initially reluctant board of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] to finance the American premiere, which took place on 2&nbsp;March 1916. The occasion was a great success; the symphony was played several more times in Philadelphia before the orchestra and choruses travelled to New York, for a series of equally well-received performances at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th Street)|Metropolitan Opera House]].<ref name=NYTimes>{{cite journal|authorlink= Abram Chasins|last= Chasins|first= Abram|title= Stokowski's Legend – Mickey Mouse to Mahler|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/18/arts/music-view-stokowski-s-legend-mickey-mouse-to-mahler.html?&pagewanted=all|journal= [[The New York Times]]|date= 18 April 1982|accessdate= 9 May 2010}}</ref>

The work was played again eight years later by the same forces; among those present in the audience was the youthful composer [[Benjamin Britten]].

The years after World War II saw a number of notable performances of the Eighth Symphony, including Sir [[Adrian Boult]]'s broadcast from the [[Royal Albert Hall]] on 10&nbsp;February 1948, the Japanese premiere under [[Kazuo Yamada]] in Tokyo in December 1949, and the Australian premiere under [[Eugene Aynsley Goossens|Sir Eugene Goossens]] in 1951.<ref name= Anderson /> A Carnegie Hall performance under Stokowski in 1950 became the first complete recording of the symphony to be issued.<ref name= List/> After 1950 the increasing numbers of performances and recordings of the work signified its growing popularity, but not all critics were won over. [[Theodor W. Adorno]] found the piece weak, "a giant symbolic shell";<ref name= Carr186>Carr, p. 186</ref> this most affirmative work of Mahler's is, in Adorno's view, his least successful, musically and artistically inferior to his other symphonies.<ref>La Grange (2000), p. 928</ref> The composer-critic [[Robert Simpson (composer)|Robert Simpson]], usually a champion of Mahler, referred to Part&nbsp;II as "an ocean of shameless kitsch."<ref name= Carr186 /> Mahler biographer [[Jonathan Carr]] finds much of the symphony "bland", lacking the tension and resolution present in the composer's other symphonies.<ref name= Carr186 /> Deryck Cooke, on the other hand, compares Mahler's Eighth to Beethoven's Choral (Ninth) Symphony. To Cooke, Mahler's is "the Choral Symphony of the twentieth century: like Beethoven's, but in a different way, it sets before us an ideal [of redemption] which we are as yet far from realising—even perhaps moving away from—but which we can hardly abandon without perishing".<ref name= Cooke93>Cooke, pp. 93–95</ref>

In the late 20th century and into the 21st, the Eighth was performed in all parts of the world. A succession of premieres in the Far East culminated in October 2002 in Beijing, when [[Long Yu]] led the [[China Philharmonic Orchestra]] in the first performance of the work in the People's Republic of China.<ref>{{cite web|title= Long Yu, Artistic Director and Principal Conductor|publisher= The Chinese Embassy, Poland|url= http://www.chinaembassy.org.pl/pol/wh/Nw/t129230.htm|year= 2004|accessdate= 9 May 2010}}</ref> The [[Sydney Olympic Arts Festival]] in August 2000 opened with a performance of the Eighth by the [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]] under its chief conductor [[Edo de Waart]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Olympic Arts Festival: Mahler's 8th Symphony|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/atoday/stories/s164126.htm|year=2007|accessdate=9 May 2010}}</ref> The popularity of the work, and its heroic scale, meant that it was often used as a set piece on celebratory occasions; on 15&nbsp;March 2008, [[Yoav Talmi]] led 200 instrumentalists and a choir of 800 in a performance in [[Quebec City]], to mark the 400th anniversary of the city's foundation.<ref>{{cite web|title= Quebec Symphony Orchestra - The Symphony of a Thousand in Québec City |publisher= Quebec Symphony Orchestra (press release)|date= 15 March 2008 |url= http://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/quebec-symphony-orchestra---the-symphony-of-a-thousand-in-quebec-city-535615761.html |accessdate= 6 May 2016}}</ref> In London on 16&nbsp;July 2010 the opening concert of the [[BBC Proms]] celebrated the 150th anniversary of Mahler's birth with a performance of the Eighth, with [[Jirí Belohlávek]] conducting the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Proms 2010: What's on/Proms by week|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/2010/whatson/season/?week1|work=Proms 2010|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)|accessdate=11 August 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724164412/http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/2010/whatson/season/?week1 <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=24 July 2010}}</ref> This performance was its eighth in the history of the Proms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/archive/search/work/symphony-no-8-in-e-flat-major-symphony-of-a-thousand/2197|title=Performances of Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major ''Symphony of a Thousand''|work=Proms Archive|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)|accessdate=1 March 2015}}</ref>

==Analysis==

===Structure and form===
The Eighth Symphony's two parts combine the sacred text of the 9th-century Latin hymn ''Veni creator spiritus'' with the secular text from the closing passages from Goethe's 19th-century dramatic poem ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]''. Despite the evident disparities within this juxtaposition, the work as a whole expresses a single idea, that of redemption through the power of love.<ref name= DLG905>La Grange (2000), pp. 905–07</ref><ref name= NewGrove>Mitchell (1980), pp. 523–24</ref> The choice of these two texts was not arbitrary; Goethe, a poet whom Mahler revered, believed that ''Veni creator'' embodied aspects of his own philosophy, and had translated it into German in 1820.<ref name= DG>Mitchell: "The Creating of the Eighth" p. 11</ref> Once inspired by the ''Veni creator'' idea, Mahler soon saw the ''Faust'' poem as an ideal counterpart to the Latin hymn.<ref>La Grange (2000), p. 891</ref> The unity between the two parts of the symphony is established, musically, by the extent to which they share thematic material. In particular, the first notes of the ''Veni creator'' theme —<br>[[E? (musical note)|E-flat]]?[[B? (musical note)|B-flat]]?[[A?

(a note on Mahler’s Eighth Symphony)|website=wordpress.com}}</ref>

In composing his score, Mahler temporarily abandoned the more progressive tonal elements which had appeared in his most recent works.<ref name= DLG905 /> The symphony's key is, for Mahler, unusually stable; despite frequent diversions into other keys the music always returns to its central [[E-flat major]].<ref name= Cooke93 /> This is the first of his works in which familiar fingerprints—birdsong, military marches, Austrian dances—are almost entirely absent.<ref name= DLG905 /> Although the vast choral and orchestral forces employed suggest a work of monumental sound, according to critic [[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Michael Kennedy]] "the predominant expression is not of torrents of sound but of the contrasts of subtle tone-colours and the luminous quality of the scoring".<ref name= K151 />

For Part I, most modern commentators accept the [[sonata form|sonata-form]] outline that was discerned by early analysts.<ref name= DLG905 /> The structure of Part&nbsp;II is more difficult to summarise, being an amalgam of many genres.<ref name= NewGrove /> Analysts, including Specht, Cooke and [[Paul Bekker]], have identified [[Italian musical terms used in English#Tempo|Adagio]], [[Scherzo]] and Finale "movements" within the overall scheme of Part&nbsp;II, though others, including La Grange and [[Donald Mitchell (writer)|Donald Mitchell]], find little to sustain this division.<ref>La Grange (2000), p. 911</ref> Musicologist Ortrun Landmann has suggested that the formal scheme for Part&nbsp;II, after the orchestral introduction, is a sonata plan without the [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]], consisting of [[Exposition (music)|exposition]], [[Musical development|development]] and conclusion.<ref name= DLG919>La Grange (2000), pp. 919–21</ref>

===Part I: ''Veni creator spiritus''===
[[File:Mahler Veni creator.jpg|thumb|upright|alt= A handwritten sheet of music, with the instrumental and choral forces listed on the left, followed by the first five bars of the symphony|Mahler's [[fair copy]] manuscript of the first page of the Eighth Symphony]]
Mitchell describes Part I as resembling a giant [[motet]], and argues that a key to its understanding is to read it as Mahler's attempt to emulate the [[polyphony]] of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s great motets, specifically ''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'' ("Sing to the Lord a new song").<ref name= NewGrove /> The symphony begins with a single [[tonic (music)|tonic chord]] in E-flat, sounded on the organ, before the entry of the massed choirs in a [[Dynamics (music)|fortissimo]] invocation: "Veni, veni creator spiritus".{{#tag:ref|English quotations from the ''Veni creator''&nbsp;&nbsp;text are taken from the translation in Cooke, pp. 94–95|group= n}}<br> <score vorbis="1"> \relative c'' { \clef treble \key ees \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \tempo "Allegro impetuoso" \autoBeamOff ees2\ff bes4 r | \time 3/4 aes'2\sf g8. f16 | \time 2/4 ees4-> f-> | \time 4/4 bes,8. bes16 bes4 } \addlyrics { Ve- ni, ve- ni, cre- a- tor spi- ri- tus! } </score>  The three note "creator" motif is immediately taken up by the trombones and then the trumpets in a marching theme that will be used as a unifying factor throughout the work.<ref name= Cooke93 /><ref name= DLG915>La Grange (2000), pp. 915–18</ref><br> <score vorbis="1">  \relative c { \clef bass \key ees \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 r4 ees->\ff bes-> aes'-> | \time 3/4 g8[ r16 f] ees'4~ | ees } </score>  After their first declamatory statement the two choirs engage in a sung dialogue, which ends with a short transition to an extended lyrical passage, "Imple superna gratia", a plea for divine grace.<br> <score vorbis="1"> \relative c'' { \clef treble \key des \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 aes2\p bes4 aes8( bes) | c2( bes8[ aes)] des([ ees)] | f4. ees8 des2 } \addlyrics { Im- ple su- per- na gra- ti- a, }  </score> Here, what Kennedy calls "the unmistakable presence of twentieth-century Mahler" is felt as a solo soprano introduces a meditative theme.<ref name= Kennedy152>Kennedy, pp. 152–53</ref> She is soon joined by other solo voices as the new theme is explored before the choirs return exuberantly, in an A-flat episode in which the soloists compete with the choral masses.<ref name= DLG915 />

In the next section, "Infirma nostri corporis/virtute firmans perpeti" ("Our weak frames fortify with thine eternal strength"), the tonic key of E-flat returns with a variation of the opening theme. The section is interrupted by a short orchestral interlude in which the low bells are sounded, adding a sombre touch to the music.<ref name= DLG915 /> This new, less secure mood is carried through when "Infirma nostri corporis" resumes, this time without the choruses, in a subdued [[D minor]] echo of the initial invocation.<ref name= Cooke93 /><br> <score vorbis="1"> \relative c' { \clef treble \key d \minor \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \partial 4*1 a4\p | f'2-> d4 r | f2-> d4 r | \autoBeamOff a'\pp g8. f16 e4 f | bes,8-. r16 bes-. bes4-. } \addlyrics { In- fir- ma no- stri, in- fir- ma no- stri cor- po- ris, } </score> At the end of this episode another transition precedes the "unforgettable surge in [[E major]]",<ref name= DLG915 /> in which the entire body of choral forces declaims "Accende lumen sensibus" ("Illuminate our senses").<br> <score vorbis="1"> \relative c'' { \clef treble \key e \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \partial 4*1 \times 2/3 { r8 r8 ais\ff-> } \breathe \bar "||" e'2-> b-> | r4 b cis dis | gis2. fis4 | \autoBeamOff e8. cis16 b4 } \addlyrics { Ac- cen- de, ac- cen- de lu- men sen- si bus, }  </score> The first children's chorus follows, in a joyful mood, as the music gathers force and pace. This is a passage of great complexity, in the form of a double fugue involving development of many of the preceding themes, with constant changes to the key signature.<ref name= Cooke93 /><ref name= DLG915 /> All forces combine again in the recapitulation of the "Veni creator" section in shortened form. A quieter passage of recapitulation leads to an orchestral coda before the children's chorus announces the [[doxology]] "Gloria sit Patri Domino" ("Glory be to God the Father").<br> <score vorbis="1"> \relative c'' { \clef treble \key des \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 des2\ff f,4 f' | des2 f,4 f' | ees des bes ges' | c,1 } \addlyrics { Glo- ri- a, glo- ri- a Pa- tri Do- mi- no. } </score> Thereafter the music moves swiftly and powerfully to its climax, in which an [[offstage brass and percussion|offstage]] brass ensemble bursts forth with the "Accende" theme while the main orchestra and choruses end on a triumphant rising scale.<ref name= Cooke93 /><ref name= DLG915 />

===Part II: Closing scene from Goethe's ''Faust''===
[[File:Mahler Chorus mysticus.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt= A handwritten sheet of music showing the orchestral score for 13 bars from the symphony|Mahler's manuscript score for the Chorus Mysticus, which provides the triumphant conclusion to the Eighth Symphony]] The second part of the symphony follows the narrative of the final stages in Goethe's poem—the journey of Faust's soul, rescued from the clutches of [[Mephistopheles]], on to its final ascent into heaven. Landmann's proposed sonata structure for the movement is based on a division, after an orchestral prelude, into five sections which he identifies musically as an exposition, three development episodes, and a finale.<ref>La Grange (2000), p. 896 and p. 912</ref>

The long orchestral prelude (166 bars) is in [[E-flat minor]] and, in the manner of an operatic overture, anticipates several of the themes which will be heard later in the movement. The exposition begins in near-silence; the scene depicted is that of a rocky, wooded mountainside, the dwelling place of [[anchorite]]s whose utterances are heard in an atmospheric chorus complete with whispers and echoes.<ref name= Kennedy152 /><ref name= Cooke93/><br> <score vorbis="1"> \relative c' { \clef bass \key ees \major \time 2/2 g2^"Pater ecstaticus" g4 g | g4. aes8 g2 | r4 f~ \times 2/3 { f g aes } | c4. bes8 bes2 } \addlyrics { E- wi- ger Won- ne- brand, glü- hen- des Lie- bes band, } </score>  A solemn baritone solo, the voice of Pater Ecstaticus, ends warmly as the key changes to the [[major scale|major]] when the trumpets sound the "Accende" theme from Part&nbsp;I. This is followed by a demanding and dramatic aria for bass, the voice of Pater Profundus, who ends his tortured meditation by asking for God's mercy on his thoughts and for enlightenment. The repeated chords in this section are reminiscent of [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Parsifal]]''.<ref name= DLG922>La Grange (2000), pp. 922–25</ref> The mood lightens with the entry of the angels and blessed boys (women's and children's choruses) bearing the soul of Faust; the music here is perhaps a relic of the "Christmas Games" scherzo envisioned in the abortive four-movement draft plan.<ref name= Kennedy152 /><br> <score vorbis="1"> \relative c'' { \clef treble \key g \major \time 2/2 <g ees>2\p\< <aes f>\! \bar "||" \key ees \major <bes g>1\p\> | <g ees>2\! r | <bes g> <c aes> | <d bes>2.( <ees c>4) | <d bes>2 } \addlyrics { Je- ne Ro- sen, aus den Hän- den } </score> The atmosphere is festive, with triumphant shouts of "Jauchzet auf!" ("Rejoice!") before the exposition ends in a postlude which refers to the "Infirma nostri corporis" music from Part&nbsp;I.<ref name= DLG922 />

The first phase of development begins as a women's chorus of the younger angels invoke a "happy company of blessed children"{{#tag:ref|Quotations from the ''Faust''&nbsp;&nbsp;text are based on the translation by David Luke, published in 1994 by Oxford University Press and used in La Grange, pp. 896–904.|group= n}} who must bear Faust's soul heavenwards. The blessed boys receive the soul gladly; their voices are joined by Doctor Marianus (tenor), who accompanies their chorus before breaking into a rapturous E major paean to the Mater Gloriosa, "Queen and ruler of the world!". As the aria ends, the male voices in the chorus echo the soloist's words to an orchestral background of viola tremolos, in a passage described by La Grange as "emotionally irresistible".<ref name= DLG922 />

In the second part of the development, the entry of the Mater Gloriosa is signalled in E major by a sustained harmonium chord, with harp [[arpeggio]]s played over a pianissimo violin melody which La Grange labels the "love" theme.<ref name= DLG922 /><br> <score vorbis="1"> \relative c'' { \clef treble \key e \major \time 2/2 b2(\pp gis') | fis( e) | r4 dis( fis) e | cis2( b) | r4 fis'( a) gis | cis,1 \bar "" } </score> Thereafter the key changes frequently as a chorus of penitent women petition the Mater for a hearing; this is followed by the solo entreaties of Magna Peccatrix, Mulier Samaritana and Maria Aegyptiaca. In these arias the "love" theme is further explored, and the "scherzo" theme associated with the first appearance of the angels returns. These two motifs predominate in the trio which follows, a request to the Mater on behalf of a fourth penitent, Faust's lover once known as Gretchen, who has come to make her plea for the soul of Faust.<ref name= DLG922 /> After Gretchen's entreaty, a solo of "limpid beauty" in Kennedy's words, an atmosphere of hushed reverence descends.<ref name= Kennedy152 /> The Mater Gloriosa then sings her only two lines, in the symphony's opening key of [[E-flat major]], permitting Gretchen to lead the soul of Faust into heaven.<ref name= DLG922 />

The final development episode is a hymn-like tenor solo and chorus, in which Doctor Marianus calls on the penitents to "Gaze aloft".<br> <score vorbis="1"> \relative c'' { \time 2/2 \clef treble \key ees \major g->\p r8 aes bes2 } \addlyrics { Blik- ket auf, } </score> A short orchestral passage follows, scored for an eccentric chamber group consisting of piccolo, flute, harmonium, celesta, piano, harps and a string quartet.<ref name= NewGrove /> This acts as a transition to the finale, the Chorus Mysticus, which begins in E-flat major almost imperceptibly—Mahler's notation here is ''Wie ein Hauch'', "like a breath".<ref name= DLG922 /><br> <score vorbis="1"> { \new PianoStaff << \new Staff \relative c'' { \key ees \major \clef treble \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 <g ees>2\ppp <g ees>4 <g ees>4 | <g f>4. <aes f>8 <g f> } \new Staff \relative c' { \clef bass \key ees \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 <bes ees, bes ees,>2 <bes ees, bes ees,>4 <bes ees, bes ees,> | <bes des, des,>4. <bes des, des,>8 <bes des, des,>4 } \addlyrics { Al- les Ver- gäng- li- che } >> } </score> The sound rises in a gradual crescendo, as the solo voices alternately join or contrast with the chorus. As the climax approaches, many themes are reprised: the love theme, Gretchen's song, the Accende from Part&nbsp;I. Finally, as the chorus concludes with "The eternal feminine draws us on high", the off-stage brass re-enters with a final salute on the Veni creator motif, to end the symphony with a triumphant flourish.<ref name= Kennedy152 /><ref name= DLG922 />

{{For|the complete discography|Symphony No. 8 (Mahler) discography}}

Sir Adrian Boult's 1948 broadcast performance with the BBC Symphony Orchestra was recorded by the BBC, but not issued until 2009 when it was made available in [[MP3]] form.<ref name= Anderson/> The first issued recording of the complete symphony was Stokowski's Carnegie Hall performance with the [[New York Philharmonic]] and combined New York choirs on 9&nbsp;April 1950. Nearly two years before, in July 1948, the Hungarian-born conductor [[Eugene Ormandy]] had recorded the "Veni creator spiritus" movement at the [[Hollywood Bowl]]. Since Stokowski's version, at least 70 recordings of the symphony have been made by many of the world's leading orchestras and singers, mostly during live performances.<ref name= List>{{cite web|title= Symphonie No 8 en Mi bémol majeur: Chronologie; Discographie: Commentaires|publisher= gustavmahler.net|url= http://gustavmahler.net.free.fr/symph8.html|accessdate= 24 April 2010}}</ref>
