==Trails==
Since the designation of the Soda Mountain Wilderness, the road leading to Boccard Point had been decommissioned, and deterioration had made it difficult to traverse. In 2014, the trail was restored by the nonprofit [[Siskiyou Mountain Club]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Boccard Point – An Easy Hike to a Very Special Place |url=http://www.siskiyoumountainclub.org/boccard-point/ |publisher=Siskiyou Mountain Club |accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref>

==Name==
The mountain was named after the American [[biologist]] and [[environmentalist]] [[Bruce Boccard]]. Boccard Point was his favorite spot on the mountain and was a point he called "Juniper Ridge". In 1997, the [[U.S. Board on Geographic Names]] approved naming the point in his honor.<ref>[http://archive.mailtribune.com/archive/98/may98/52498n3.htm Landform given biologist's name], Paul Fattig in ''[[Mail Tribune]]'', May 24, 1998 {{dead link|date=May 2016}}</ref>
