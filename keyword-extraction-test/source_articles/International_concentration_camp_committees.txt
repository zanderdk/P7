'''International concentration camp committees''' are organizations composed of former inmates of the various [[Nazi]] [[concentration camp]]s, formed at various times, primarily after the [[Second World War]]. Although most survivors have since died and those who are still alive are generally octogenarians, the committees are still active.

== Committees' history and purpose ==
During the [[Nazi era]], there were active, underground resistance organizations at several of the camps, such as those at [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]], [[Buchenwald Resistance|Buchenwald]] and [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]]. After liberation, these groups became the foundation of post-war survivor organizations for their respective camps.<ref>[http://english.ruvr.ru/2010/04/12/6289056.html "65 years since liberation of Buchenwald"] (April 12, 2010). Retrieved April 17, 2010.</ref>

The concentration camp committees are international organizations because their members come from and live in many different countries. The purpose of the committees is to educate the world about what was done under the [[Third Reich]] regarding the arrest and deportation of religious, political and social groups considered "undesirable" by the [[National Socialists]]. They also serve to care for the survivors of Nazi brutality, and finally, the committees facilitate communication and cooperation among survivors.<ref>[http://www.auschwitz.info/e/history.html History of the International Auschwitz Committee] Retrieved April 17, 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.internationales-sachsenhausen-komitee.eu/index_homenews1.htm Description of the International Sachsenhausen Committee], official website.

A document was produced under the auspices of the [[International Auschwitz Committee]] that was signed by representatives of ten different Nazi concentration camps in [[Berlin]] on January 25, 2010. It refers to the pledge taken by survivors to work for peace and freedom, to remember the past and work to keep [[fascism]] from gaining ascendancy and noting the thinning ranks of their own members, it calls on young people to take up the work for future generations.<ref>[http://www.bergenbelsen.de/pdf/Vermaechtnis-engl.pdf "Preserve Remembrance — Conserve Authentic Places — Assume Responsibility"] (PDF) Document signed by representatives of 10 Nazi concentration camp committees.
