===Synopsis===
In the video for "Single Ladies", emphasis is laid on Beyoncé's more aggressive and sensual side, her alter ego Sasha Fierce. It shows her in an asymmetrical [[leotard]] and high-heels, with two backup dancers, Ebony Williams and [[Ashley Everett]].<ref name="mtv1"/> Beyoncé's mother, [[Tina Knowles]], designed the high-cut leotards after seeing something similar in the American [[musical film]]s ''[[A Chorus Line (film)|A Chorus Line]]'' and ''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]]''.<ref name="people"/> The dance routine incorporates many styles, including [[jazz dance|jazz]], [[tap dance|tap]], and [[hip hop dance|hip hop]], and is credited with popularizing [[J-Setting]], a flamboyant [[lead and follow]] dance style prominent in many African American gay clubs across Atlanta and used by the all-female [[Jackson State University#Sonic Boom of the South|Prancing J-Settes]] dance troupe of [[Jackson State University]].<ref name="changes"/><ref name="chi">{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-01-08/news/0901070892_1_dancers-single-ladies-beyonce|title=Is one of the ladies in Beyoncé's 'Single Ladies' video actually a man?|last=Eng|first=Monica|date=January 8, 2009|work=Chicago Tribune |publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=December 15, 2010}}</ref>

The video features Beyoncé and her two companions dancing inside an [[infinity cove]], which alternates between black and white and places the focus on the complex choreography. Throughout the video the women click their heels and shake their hips and legs. However, the main intention is to attract the viewers' attention toward their hands and ring fingers as they do the hand-twirl move.<ref name="mtv1"/> At one point during the video, the dancers run up to a wall, which, according to Frank Gatson Jr., pays homage to [[Shirley MacLaine]]'s act in the 1969 film ''[[Sweet Charity (film)|Sweet Charity]]''.<ref name="people"/> Toward the end of the video, Beyoncé flashes her own wedding ring on her finger.<ref name="people"/><ref name="mtv1"/>

Although the video for "Single Ladies" was the cheapest and quickest of all her videos to produce, Beyoncé felt that it ended up being "the most iconic&nbsp;... something special".<ref name=lioa/> It spawned a [[Novelty and fad dances|dance craze]] and inspired thousands of imitations all over the world, many of which were posted on [[YouTube]].<ref name="people"/> In an interview with MTV, Beyoncé expressed her appreciation of the public's response to the video, and stated that she had spent much time watching several of these parodies: "It's beautiful to feel you touch people and bring a song to life with a video."<ref name="lady"/> Nava also expressed his surprise at the positive reception of the video, and attributed its success to the video's understated, less-is-more approach.<ref name=lad/> In an interview with Chandler Levack for ''Eye Weekly'', Toronto director Scott Cudmore stated that the Internet age has impacted the way music videos are made, as well as perceived by an audience. Although Cudmore believes that the music video as a medium is "disappearing ... from the mainstream public eye", he accredited "Single Ladies" with its resurgence, and stated that after the video appeared on the Internet, people began to "consciously look for music videos because of its art".<ref name="cudmore">{{cite news|first=Chandler|last=Levack |title=Living on in video – Music clip installation series looks behind the camera|url=http://www.eyeweekly.com/film/feature/article/65383|publisher=Torstar|work=Eye Weekly|date=July 8, 2009|archiveurl=http://archives.eyeweekly.com/feature/article/65383 |archivedate=November 20, 2011|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}</ref>

"Single Ladies" was nominated for nine awards at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, ultimately winning three including Video of the Year. Its failure to win the Best Female Video category, which went to American [[country pop]] singer [[Taylor Swift]]'s "[[You Belong with Me]]", sparked controversy during the ceremony. Swift's acceptance speech was interrupted by rapper [[Kanye West]], who grabbed her microphone to declare the "Single Ladies" video as "one of the best videos of all time".<ref name="rant"/> Footage of Beyoncé in the audience looking shocked was then shown. When Beyoncé won the Video of the Year award later that night, she reminisced about when she won her first MTV award with her former group, [[Destiny's Child]], and called the experience "one of the most exciting moments in [her] life". She then invited Swift on-stage to finish her speech and "have her moment".<ref name="rant">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1621410/kanye-west-apologizes-taylor-swift-vma-rant.jhtml |title=Kanye West Apologizes To Taylor Swift For VMA Rant |first=Hillary |last=Crosley |publisher=MTV News.
