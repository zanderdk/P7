'''Punk rock''' (or simply '''punk''') is a [[rock music]] [[genre]] that developed between 1974 and 1976 in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in [[garage rock]] and other forms of what is now known as [[proto-punk]] music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream [[1970s in music|1970s]] rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, [[anti-establishment]] lyrics. Punk embraces a [[DIY ethic]]; many bands self-produced recordings and distributed them through informal channels.

The term "punk" was first used in relation to rock music by some American critics in the early 1970s, to describe garage bands and their devotees. By late 1976, bands such as [[Television (band)|Television]] and the [[Ramones]] in [[New York City]], and the [[Sex Pistols]], [[the Clash]], and [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]] in [[London]] were recognized as the vanguard of a new musical movement. The following year saw punk rock spreading around the world, and it became a major cultural phenomenon in the United Kingdom. For the most part, punk took root in local scenes that tended to reject association with the [[mainstream]]. An associated [[punk subculture]] emerged, expressing youthful rebellion and characterized by distinctive [[Punk fashion|styles of clothing and adornment]] (ranging from deliberately offensive T-shirts, leather jackets, spike bands and other studded or spiked jewelry to bondage and S&M clothes) and a variety of [[Punk ideologies|anti-authoritarian ideologies]].

By the beginning of the 1980s, faster, more aggressive styles such as [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] (e.g. [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]]) and [[street punk]] (e.g. [[the Exploited]]) had become the predominant mode of punk rock. Musicians identifying with or inspired by punk also pursued a broad range of other variations, giving rise to [[post-punk]] and the [[alternative rock]] movement. At the end of the 20th century, punk rock had been adopted by the mainstream, as [[pop punk]] and punk rock bands such as [[Green Day]], [[the Offspring]] and [[Blink-182]] brought the genre widespread popularity.

The first wave of punk rock was aggressively modern, distancing itself from the bombast and sentimentality of early 1970s rock.<ref name="RMB">Robb (2006), foreword by Michael Bracewell.</ref> According to [[Ramones]] drummer [[Tommy Ramone]], "In its initial form, a lot of [1960s] stuff was innovative and exciting. Unfortunately, what happens is that people who could not hold a candle to the likes of [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] started noodling away. Soon you had endless solos that went nowhere. By 1973, I knew that what was needed was some pure, stripped down, no bullshit rock 'n' roll."<ref>Ramone, Tommy, "Fight Club", ''[[UNCUT (magazine)|Uncut]]'', January 2007.</ref> [[John Holmstrom]], founding editor of ''[[Punk (magazine)|Punk]]'' magazine, recalls feeling "punk rock had to come along because the rock scene had become so tame that [acts] like [[Billy Joel]] and [[Simon and Garfunkel]] were being called rock and roll, when to me and other fans, rock and roll meant this wild and rebellious music."<ref name="MM">McLaren, Malcolm, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5263364.stm "Punk Celebrates 30 Years of Subversion"], BBC News, August 18, 2006. Retrieved on January 17, 2006.</ref> In critic [[Robert Christgau]]'s description, "It was also a subculture that scornfully rejected the political idealism and Californian flower-power silliness of hippie myth."<ref>Christgau, Robert, [http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bkrev/mcneil-nyt.php "''Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk'', by Legs McNeil and Gillian McCain" (review)], ''New York Times Book Review'', 1996. Retrieved on January 17, 2007.</ref>

Technical accessibility and a [[Do it yourself|DIY]] spirit are prized in punk rock. In the early days of punk rock, this ethic stood in marked contrast to what those in the scene regarded as the ostentatious musical effects and technological demands of many mainstream rock bands.<ref>Rodel (2004), p. 237; Bennett (2001), pp. 49–50.</ref> Musical virtuosity was often looked on with suspicion. According to Holmstrom, punk rock was "rock and roll by people who didn't have very much skills as musicians but still felt the need to express themselves through music".<ref name="MM"/> In December 1976, the English [[fanzine]] ''Sideburns'' published a now-famous illustration of three chords, captioned "This is a chord, this is another, this is a third. Now form a band".<ref>Savage (1992), pp. 280–281, including reproduction of the original image. Several sources incorrectly ascribe the illustration to the leading fanzine of the London punk scene, ''[[Sniffin' Glue]]'' (e.g., Wells [2004], p. 5; Sabin [1999], p. 111). Robb (2006) ascribes it to [[the Stranglers]]' in-house fanzine, ''Strangled'' (p. 311). In fact, ''Strangled'', which only began appearing in 1977, evolved out of ''Sideburns'' (see, e.g., {{cite web|url=http://www.xulucomics.com/strangled.html|title=''Strangled'' |publisher=Xulu Brand Comics|accessdate=2009-03-19}})</ref> The title of a 1980 single by the New York punk band Stimulators, "Loud Fast Rules!" inscribed a catchphrase for punk's basic musical approach.<ref>Blush (2001), pp. 173, 175. See also [http://www.kbdrecords.com/2006/09/21/the-stimulators-loud-fast-rules-7/ The Stimulators—Loud Fast Rules 7?] Killed By Death Records (September 21, 2006).</ref>

Some of British punk rock's leading figures made a show of rejecting not only contemporary mainstream rock and the broader culture it was associated with, but their own most celebrated music predecessors: "No [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]], [[The Beatles|Beatles]] or [[the Rolling Stones]] in 1977", declared [[the Clash]] song "1977".<ref>Harris (2004), p. 202.</ref> The previous year, when the punk rock revolution began in Great Britain, was to be both a musical and a cultural "Year Zero".<ref name="Reynolds p4">Reynolds (2005), p. 4.</ref> Even as nostalgia was discarded, many in the scene adopted a [[nihilism|nihilistic]] attitude summed up by the [[Sex Pistols]] slogan "No Future";<ref name="RMB"/> in the later words of one observer, amid the unemployment and social unrest in 1977, "punk's nihilistic swagger was the most thrilling thing in England."<ref>Jeffries, Stuart. "A Right Royal Knees-Up". ''The Guardian''. July 20, 2007.</ref> While "self-imposed [[social alienation|alienation]]" was common among "drunk punks" and "gutter punks", there was always a tension between their nihilistic outlook and the "radical leftist utopianism"<ref>Washburne, Christopher, and Maiken Derno. ''Bad Music''. Routledge, 2004. Page 247.</ref> of bands such as [[Crass]], who found positive, liberating meaning in the movement. As a Clash associate describes singer [[Joe Strummer]]'s outlook, "Punk rock is meant to be our freedom. We're meant to be able to do what we want to do."<ref>Kosmo Vinyl, ''The Last Testament: The Making of London Calling'' (Sony Music, 2004).</ref>

The issue of authenticity is important in the punk subculture—the pejorative term "[[poseur]]" is applied to those who associate with punk and adopt its stylistic attributes but are deemed not to share or understand the underlying values and philosophy. Scholar Daniel S. Traber argues that "attaining authenticity in the punk identity can be difficult"; as the punk scene matured, he observes, eventually "everyone got called a poseur".<ref>{{cite journal |pages=30–64 |doi=10.1353/cul.2001.0040 |title=L.A.'s 'White Minority': Punk and the Contradictions of Self-Marginalization |year=2001 |last1=Traber |first1=Daniel S. |journal=Cultural Critique |volume=48}}</ref>

===Musical and lyrical elements===
[[File:Sex Pistols in Paradiso - Johnny Rotten & Steve Jones.jpg|thumb|left|Johnny Rotten and Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols]]
Punk rock bands often emulate the bare musical structures and arrangements of 1960s [[garage rock]].<ref>Murphy, Peter, "Shine On, The Lights Of The Bowery: The Blank Generation Revisited," ''Hot Press'', July 12, 2002; [[Barney Hoskyns|Hoskyns, Barney]], "Richard Hell: King Punk Remembers the [ ] Generation," ''[[Rock's Backpages]]'', March 2002.</ref> Typical punk rock instrumentation includes one or two electric guitars, an electric bass, and a drum kit, along with vocals. Songs tend to be shorter than those of other popular genres. Most early punk rock songs retained a traditional rock 'n' roll [[verse-chorus form]] and 4/4 [[time signature]]. However, later bands have often broken from this format. In critic Steven Blush's description, "The Sex Pistols were still rock'n'roll ... like the craziest version of [[Chuck Berry]]. [[Hardcore punk|Hardcore]] was a radical departure from that. It wasn't verse-chorus rock. It dispelled any notion of what songwriting is supposed to be. It's its own form."<ref name="blush">Blush, Steven, "Move Over My Chemical Romance: The Dynamic Beginnings of US Punk," ''[[UNCUT (magazine)|Uncut]]'', January 2007.</ref>

Punk rock vocals sometimes sound nasal,<ref>Wells (2004), p. 41; Reed (2005), p. 47.</ref> and lyrics are often shouted instead of sung in a conventional sense, particularly in hardcore styles.<ref name="S159">Shuker (2002), p. 159.</ref> Shifts in pitch, volume, or intonational style are relatively infrequent.<ref>{{harvp|Laing|1985|p=58}}; Reynolds (2005), p. ix.</ref> Complicated guitar solos are considered self-indulgent and unnecessary, although basic guitar breaks are common.<ref>Chong, Kevin, [http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/guitarsolos.html "The Thrill Is Gone"], Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, August 2006. Retrieved on December 17, 2006.</ref> Guitar parts tend to include highly [[distortion pedal|distorted]] [[power chord]]s or [[barre chord]]s, creating a characteristic sound described by Christgau as a "buzzsaw drone".<ref>Quoted in {{harvp|Laing|1985|p=62}}</ref> Some punk rock bands take a [[surf music|surf rock]] approach with a lighter, twangier guitar tone. Others, such as [[Robert Quine]], lead guitarist of [[the Voidoids]], have employed a wild, "[[Gonzo journalism|gonzo]]" attack, a style that stretches back through [[the Velvet Underground]] to the 1950s recordings of [[Ike Turner]].<ref>Palmer (1992), p. 37.</ref> Bass guitar lines are often uncomplicated; the quintessential approach is a relentless, repetitive "forced rhythm",{{sfn|Laing|1985|p=62}} although some punk rock bass players—such as [[Mike Watt]] of [[Minutemen (band)|the Minutemen]] and [[Firehose (band)|Firehose]]—emphasize more technical bass lines. Bassists often use a [[Plectrum|pick]] due to the rapid succession of notes, which makes [[fingerpicking]] impractical. Drums typically sound heavy and dry, and often have a minimal set-up. Compared to other forms of rock, [[syncopation]] is much less the rule.<ref>{{harvp|Laing|1985|pp=61–63}}</ref> Hardcore drumming tends to be especially fast.<ref name="S159"/> Production tends to be minimalistic, with tracks sometimes laid down on home tape recorders{{sfn|Laing|1985|pp=118–19}} or simple four-track portastudios. The typical objective is to have the recording sound unmanipulated and "real", reflecting the commitment and "authenticity" of a live performance.{{sfn|Laing|1985|p=53}}

[[File:Clash 21051980 12 800.jpg|right|thumb|[[The Clash]], performing in 1980]]
Punk rock lyrics are typically frank and confrontational; compared to the lyrics of other popular music genres, they frequently comment on social and political issues.<ref>Sabin (1999), pp. 4, 226; Dalton, Stephen, "Revolution Rock", ''Vox'', June 1993. See also Laing (1985), pp. 27–32, for a statistical comparison of lyrical themes.</ref> Trend-setting songs such as the Clash's "[[Career Opportunities (song)|Career Opportunities]]" and [[Chelsea (band)|Chelsea]]'s "Right to Work" deal with unemployment and the grim realities of urban life.<ref>Laing (1985), p. 31.</ref> Especially in early British punk, a central goal was to outrage and shock the mainstream.<ref>Laing (1985), pp. 81, 125.</ref> The Sex Pistols'  "[[Anarchy in the U.K.]]" and "[[God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)|God Save the Queen]]" openly disparaged the British political system and social mores. Anti-sentimental depictions of relationships and sex are common, as in "Love Comes in Spurts", written by [[Richard Hell]] and recorded by him with the Voidoids. [[Anomie]], variously expressed in the poetic terms of Hell's "[[Blank Generation (song)|Blank Generation]]" and the bluntness of the Ramones' "Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue", is a common theme. Identifying punk with such topics aligns with the view expressed by [[V. Vale]], founder of San Francisco fanzine ''[[RE/Search|Search and Destroy]]'': "Punk was a total cultural revolt. It was a hardcore confrontation with the black side of history and culture, right-wing imagery, sexual taboos, a delving into it that had never been done before by any generation in such a thorough way".<ref>Savage (1991), p. 440. See also Laing (1985), pp. 27–32.</ref>

===Visual and other elements===
{{Details|Punk fashion}}

The classic punk rock look among male American musicians harkens back to the T-shirt, motorcycle jacket, and jeans ensemble favored by American [[Greaser (subculture)|greasers]] of the 1950s associated with the [[rockabilly]] scene and by British [[Rocker (subculture)|rockers]] of the 1960s. The cover of the Ramones' 1976 debut album, featuring a shot of the band by ''Punk'' photographer Roberta Bayley, set forth the basic elements of a style that was soon widely emulated by rock musicians both punk and nonpunk.<ref name=RamonesCover/> Richard Hell's more androgynous, ragamuffin look—and reputed invention of the [[safety pin#Culture|safety-pin aesthetic]]—was a major influence on Sex Pistols impresario [[Malcolm McLaren]] and, in turn, British punk style.<ref name="RHV">{{cite web|author1=Isler, Scott |author2=Robbins, Ira |title=Richard Hell & the Voidoids |work=[[Trouser Press]]|url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=richard_hell_and_the_voidoids|accessdate=2007-10-23}}</ref><ref>Strongman (2008), pp. 58, 63, 64; Colegrave and Sullivan (2005), p. 78.</ref> ([[John D Morton]] of Cleveland's [[Electric Eels (band)|Electric Eels]] may have been the first rock musician to wear a safety-pin-covered jacket).<ref>See {{cite web|author=Weldon, Michael|title=Electric Eels: Attendance Required |url=http://www.cleveland.com/music/index_story.ssf?/music/more/local/cle/2/index.html|publisher=Cleveland.com|accessdate=December 19, 2010}}</ref> McLaren's partner, fashion designer [[Vivienne Westwood]], credits Johnny Rotten as the first British punk to rip his shirt, and Sex Pistols bassist [[Sid Vicious]] as the first to use safety pins,<ref>{{cite web |author=Young, Charles M. |date=October 20, 1977| title=Rock Is Sick and Living in London |work=Rolling Stone |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thebeatles/articles/story/9437647/sex_pistols_rock_is_sick_and_living_in_london?source=thebeatles_rssfeed |accessdate=October 10, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914225550/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thebeatles/articles/story/9437647/sex_pistols_rock_is_sick_and_living_in_london?source=thebeatles_rssfeed |archivedate=September 14, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref> although few of those following Punk could afford to buy McLaren and Westwood's designs so famously worn by the Pistols, so they made their own, diversifying the 'look' with various different styles based on these designs.

[[File:punks.jpg|left|thumb|British punks, circa 1986]]
The characteristic stage performance style of male punk musicians does not deviate significantly from the macho postures classically associated with rock music.<ref>Laing (1985), pp. 89, 97–98, 125.</ref> Female punk musicians broke more clearly from earlier styles. Scholar John Strohm suggests that they did so by creating personas of a type conventionally seen as masculine: "They adopted a tough, unladylike pose that borrowed more from the macho swagger of sixties garage bands than from the calculated bad-girl image of bands like [[the Runaways]]."<ref name="Strohm" /> Scholar Dave Laing describes how bassist [[Gaye Advert]] adopted fashion elements associated with male musicians only to generate a stage persona readily consumed as "sexy".<ref>Laing (1985), p. 92, 88.</ref> Laing focuses on more innovative and challenging performance styles, seen in the various erotically destabilizing approaches of Siouxsie Sioux, [[the Slits]]' [[Ari Up]], and [[X-Ray Spex]]' [[Poly Styrene]].<ref>Laing (1985), pp. 89, 92–93.</ref>

The lack of emphatic syncopation led punk dance to "deviant" forms. The characteristic style was originally the [[Pogo (dance)|pogo]].<ref>Laing (1985), pp. 34, 61, 63, 89–91.</ref> Sid Vicious, before he became the Sex Pistols' bassist, is credited with initiating the pogo in Britain as an attendee at one of their concerts.<ref>Laing (1985), p. 90; Robb (2006), pp. 159–60.</ref> [[Moshing]] (Slam Dancing) is typical at hardcore shows. The lack of conventional dance rhythms was a central factor in limiting punk's mainstream commercial impact.{{sfn|Laing|1985|p=34}}

Breaking down the distance between performer and audience is central to the punk ethic.{{sfn|Laing|1985|p=82}} Fan participation at concerts is thus important; during the movement's first heyday, it was often provoked in an adversarial manner—apparently perverse, but appropriately "punk". First-wave British punk bands such as the Sex Pistols and [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]] insulted and otherwise goaded the audience into intense reactions. Laing has identified three primary forms of audience physical response to goading: can throwing, stage invasion, and spitting or "gobbing".{{sfn|Laing|1985|pp=84–85}} In the hardcore realm, stage invasion is often a prelude to [[stage diving]]. In addition to the numerous fans who have started or joined punk bands, audience members also become important participants via the scene's many amateur periodicals—in England, according to Laing, punk "was the first musical genre to spawn fanzines in any significant numbers".{{sfn|Laing|1985|p=14}}

[[File:Louie Louie rhythm.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The 10-note riff from "[[Louie, Louie]]"]]

In the early- to mid-1960s, garage rock bands, often recognized as punk rock's progenitors, began springing up around North America. [[The Kingsmen]], from Portland, Oregon, had a hit with their 1963 cover of "[[Louie, Louie]]," considered by some as punk rock's defining "[[Urtext edition|ur-text]]."{{sfn|Sabin|1999|p=157}}  The iconic song was originally written and performed by [[Richard Berry (musician)|Richard Berry]] as an ode to the lovelorn confessions of a drunken Jamaican sailor and displays Latin influences, with its "El Loco Cha-Cha" riffs that were later pared down to a more simple and primitive rock arrangement in the Kingsmen's version providing a stylistic model for countless garage rock bands to come.<ref name="Pareles (Berry Obituary)">{{cite web|last1=Pareles|first1=Jon|title=Richard Berry, Songwriter of 'Louie Louie,' Dies at 61|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/25/arts/richard-berry-songwriter-of-louie-louie-dies-at-61.html|website=New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=April 27, 2016|date=January 25, 1997}}</ref><ref>Avant-Mier, Roberto (2008).

ISBN 1441164480.</ref>  After the Beatles' first appearance on the ''Ed Sullivan Show'', and then with the subsequent string of other successful British acts, the garage band phenomenon gathered increased momentum.  The minimalist sound of many garage rock combos was influenced by the harder-edged wing of the [[British Invasion]], exemplified by groups such as [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[the Yardbirds]]. After 1967, U.S. garage rock began to fall out of favor, but the raw sound and outsider attitude of groups, such as [[the Sonics]], [[the Seeds]], [[the Remains]], [[the Standells]], and [[the Shadows of Knight]] predicted the style of later bands such as MC5 and the Stooges.{{sfn|Sabin|1999|p=159}}  In the early 1970s, certain rock critics began to speak of the mid-1960s garage bands (as well bands that they considered continuing in their line, such as MC5 and the Stooges) as a genre that they called "punk rock."<ref>Bangs, Lester. ''Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung.'' Anchor Books, a division of Random House. 2003. pg. 8, 56, 57, 61, 64, 101: reprints of articles which appeared in 1971 and 1972, that refer to garage bands such as the Count Five and the Troggs as "punk";  pg. 101 associates "Iggy" and "Jonathan of Modern Lovers" with the Troggs and their ilk (as being punk); pg. 112–113 speak of the Guess Who as "punk"—[[the Guess Who]] had made recordings (i.e. their hit version of Shakin' All Over," 1965) as a garage rock outfit in the mid-1960s; pg. 8 makes a general statement about "punk rock" (garage) as a genre: "... then punk bands started cropping up who were writing their own songs but taking the Yardbirds' sound and reducing it to this kind of goony fuzztone clatter ... oh, it was beautiful, it was pure folklore, Old America, and sometimes I think those were the best days ever."; pg. 225 is a reprint from article which appeared in late-70s, that refers back to garage bands as "punk"</ref><ref>Laing, Dave. ''One Chord Wonders: Power and Meaning in Punk Rock.'' PM Press. Oakland, CA 2015. pg. 22–23. Laing writes that the term, "punk rock" was used "generically" (i.e. as to designate a genre) in the early 70s to describe mid-1960s garage rock bands—he quotes Greg Shaw from the late 70s referring to how it was used in the early 70s to designate the genre: "Punk rock in those days was a quaint fanzine term for a transient form of mid-60s music ..."  Pg. 21 recognizes a "strand" of punk that started long before the mid 70s, but this view is not intended to be late-70s "retrospectivism," but rather, based on testimony from early 70s critics, as the next two pages emphasize. Pg. 23 emphasizes that the development of the punk "aesthetic" started with the early 70s critics (although the actual subculture would not manifest until the mid 70s).[http://www.pmpress.org/content/index.php]</ref>  However, since the advent of New York and London scenes of 1975-1978 and the subculture that grew out of them, the term has become most commonly applied to music emerging after 1974.  Sixties garage bands are now typically described as [[garage rock]], or, especially in the case of their immediate successors, [[proto-punk]].<ref name="G. Thompson; 2007; 134">G.

From England in 1964, largely under the grip of the [[Mod subculture|mod]] youth movement and beat group explosion, came [[the Kinks]]' hit singles, "[[You Really Got Me]]" and "[[All Day and All of the Night]]," both influenced by "Louie, Louie".<ref>Kitts, Thomas M. ''Ray Davies: Not Like Everybody Else''. Routledge. 2007. Pg. 41</ref> They have been described as "predecessors of the whole three-chord genre." For instance, the Ramones' 1978 'I Don't Want You,' was largely Kink's-influenced.<ref>Harrington (2002), p. 165.</ref> In 1965, [[the Who]] progressed from their first single, "[[I Can't Explain]]," a virtual Kinks clone, to "[[My Generation]]". Though it had little impact on the American charts, the Who's mod anthem pre-figured the kind of "cerebral mix of musical ferocity and rebellious posture"<ref name="Reed 2005, p. 49">Reed (2005), p. 49.</ref> that would characterize much of the later British punk rock of the 1970s. John Reed describes the Clash's emergence as a "tight ball of energy with both an image and rhetoric reminiscent of a young [[Pete Townshend]]—speed obsession, pop-art clothing, art school ambition."<ref name="Reed 2005, p. 49"/> The Who and fellow mods [[the Small Faces]] were among the few rock elders acknowledged by the Sex Pistols.<ref>Fletcher (2000), p. 497.</ref>

In August 1969, [[the Stooges]], from [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], premiered with a [[The Stooges (album)|self-titled album]]. According to critic [[Greil Marcus]], the band, led by singer [[Iggy Pop]], created "the sound of [[Chuck Berry]]'s [[You Can't Catch Me|Airmobile]]—after thieves stripped it for parts".<ref>Marcus (1979), p. 294.</ref> The album was produced by [[John Cale]], a former member of New York's experimental rock group [[the Velvet Underground]].

===Etymology===
Between the late 16th and the 18th centuries, ''[[wikt:punk|punk]]'' was a common, coarse synonym for ''prostitute''; William Shakespeare used it with that meaning in ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' (1602) and ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' (1623).<ref>Dickson (1982), p. 230.</ref> The term eventually came to describe "a young male hustler, a gangster, a hoodlum, or a ruffian".<ref>Leblanc (1999), p. 35.</ref> As [[Legs McNeil]] explains, "On TV, if you watched cop shows, ''[[Kojak]]'', ''[[Baretta]]'', when the cops finally catch the mass murderer, they'd say, 'you dirty Punk.' It was what your teachers would call you. It meant that you were the lowest."<ref>Quoted in Leblanc (1999), p. 35.</ref> The first known use of the phrase ''punk rock'' appeared in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' on March 22, 1970, attributed to [[Ed Sanders]], cofounder of New York's anarcho-prankster band [[the Fugs]]. Sanders was quoted describing a solo album of his as "punk rock—redneck sentimentality".<ref>Shapiro (2006), p. 492.</ref> In the December 1970 issue of ''[[Creem]]'', Lester Bangs, mocking more mainstream rock musicians, ironically referred to Iggy Pop as "that Stooge punk".<ref>Bangs, Lester, [http://www.creemmagazine.com/_site/BeatGoesOn/IggyPop/OfPopAndPiesPt001.html "Of Pop and Pies and Fun"], ''Creem'', December 1970.

[[Dave Marsh]] was the first music critic to employ the term ''punk rock'': In the May 1971 issue of ''[[Creem]]'', he described [[Question Mark & the Mysterians|? and the Mysterians]], one of the most popular 1960s garage rock acts, as giving a "landmark exposition of punk rock".<ref>Shapiro (2006), p. 492. Note that Taylor (2003) misidentifies the year of publication as 1970 (p. 16).</ref> Later in 1971, in his fanzine ''[[Bomp!|Who Put the Bomp]]'', [[Greg Shaw]] wrote about "what I have chosen to call "punkrock" bands—white teenage hard rock of '64–66 ([[Standells]], Kingsmen, [[Shadows of Knight]], etc.)".<ref>Gendron (2002), p. 348 n. 13.</ref> [[Robert Christgau]] writing for the Village Voice in October 1971 refers to "mid-60s punk" as a historical period of rock-and-roll.<ref name="Christgau (60s punk)">{{cite journal|last1=Christgau|first1=Robert|title=Consumer Guide (20)|journal=Village Voice|date=October 14, 1971|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cg20.php|accessdate=July 23, 2016}}</ref>  [[Lester Bangs]] would use the term "punk rock" in several articles written in the early 1970s to refer to mid-1960s garage acts. In his June 1971 piece in ''Creem'', "Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung," he wrote, "then punk bands started cropping up who were writing their own songs but taking the Yardbirds' sound and reducing it to this kind of goony fuzztone clatter. ... oh, it was beautiful, it was pure folklore, Old America, and sometimes I think those were the best days ever."<ref>Bangs, Lester.

''Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung''.  Anchor Books, a division of Random House. 2003.

The origins of New York's punk rock scene can be traced back to such sources as late 1960s [[trash culture]] and an early 1970s [[underground rock]] movement centered on the [[Mercer Arts Center]] in [[Greenwich Village]], where the [[New York Dolls]] performed.{{sfn|Savage|1991|pp=86–90, 59–60}} In early 1974, a new scene began to develop around the [[CBGB]] club, also in [[lower Manhattan]]. At its core was [[Television (band)|Television]], described by critic John Walker as "the ultimate garage band with pretensions".<ref name="W">Walker (1991), p. 662.</ref> Their influences ranged from the Velvet Underground to the staccato guitar work of [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]]'s [[Wilko Johnson]].<ref>Strongman (2008), pp. 53, 54, 56.</ref> The band's bassist/singer, [[Richard Hell]], created a look with cropped, ragged hair, ripped T-shirts, and black leather jackets credited as the basis for punk rock visual style.<ref name="S89">Savage (1992), p. 89.</ref> In April 1974, [[Patti Smith]], a member of the Mercer Arts Center crowd and a friend of Hell's, came to CBGB for the first time to see the band perform.<ref>Bockris and Bayley (1999), p. 102.</ref> A veteran of independent theater and performance poetry, Smith was developing an intellectual, feminist take on rock 'n' roll. On June 5, she recorded the single "[[Hey Joe]]"/"[[Piss Factory]]", featuring Television guitarist [[Tom Verlaine]]; released on her own Mer Records label, it heralded the scene's [[do it yourself]] (DIY) ethic and has often been cited as the first punk rock record.<ref>{{cite web|title=Patti Smith—Biography|publisher=Arista Records|url=http://www.arista.com/psmith/smithbio.html|accessdate=2007-10-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103053048/http://www.arista.com/psmith/smithbio.html |archivedate=November 3, 2007|deadurl=yes}} Strongman (2008), p. 57; Savage (1991), p. 91; Pareles and Romanowski (1983), p. 511; Bockris and Bayley (1999), p. 106.</ref> By August, Smith and Television were gigging together at another downtown New York club, [[Max's Kansas City]].<ref name="S89"/>

Out in [[Forest Hills, Queens]], several miles from lower Manhattan, the members of a newly formed band adopted a common surname. Drawing on sources ranging from the Stooges to [[the Beatles]] and [[the Beach Boys]] to [[Herman's Hermits]] and 1960s [[girl group]]s, the [[Ramones]] condensed rock 'n' roll to its primal level: "'1-2-3-4!' bass-player [[Dee Dee Ramone]] shouted at the start of every song, as if the group could barely master the rudiments of rhythm."{{sfn|Savage|1991|pp=90–91}} The band played its first gig at CBGB on August 16, 1974, on the same bill as another new act, Angel and the Snake, soon to be renamed [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]].{{sfn|Gimarc|2005|p=14}} By the end of the year, the Ramones had performed seventy-four shows, each about seventeen minutes long.<ref>Bessman (1993), p. 27.</ref> "When I first saw the Ramones", critic [[Mary Harron]] later remembered, "I couldn't believe people were doing this. The dumb brattiness."{{sfn|Savage|1991|pp=132–33}} [[The Dictators]], with a similar "playing dumb" concept, were recording their debut album. The Dictators' ''[[Go Girl Crazy!]]'' came out in March 1975, mixing absurdist originals such as "Master Race Rock" and loud, straight-faced covers of cheese pop like [[Sonny & Cher]]'s "[[I Got You Babe]]".<ref>{{cite web|author=Deming, Mark|title="''The Dictators Go Girl Crazy!''"

That spring, Smith and Television shared a two-month-long weekend residency at CBGB that significantly raised the club's profile.<ref>Bockris and Bayley (1999), p. 119.</ref> The Television sets included Richard Hell's "Blank Generation", which became the scene's emblematic anthem.<ref>Savage (1992) claims that "Blank Generation" was written around this time (p. 90). However, the Richard Hell anthology album ''Spurts'' includes a live Television recording of the song that he dates "spring 1974."</ref> Soon after, Hell left Television and founded a band featuring a more stripped-down sound, [[the Heartbreakers]], with former New York Dolls [[Johnny Thunders]] and [[Jerry Nolan]]. The pairing of Hell and Thunders, in one critical assessment, "inject[ed] a poetic intelligence into mindless self-destruction".<ref name="RHV"/> A July festival at CBGB featuring over thirty new groups brought the scene its first substantial media coverage.<ref>Strongman (2008), p. 96; Savage (1992), p. 130.</ref> In August, Television—with Fred Smith, former Blondie bassist, replacing Hell—recorded a single, "Little Johnny Jewel", for the tiny Ork label. In the words of John Walker, the record was "a turning point for the whole New York scene" if not quite for the punk rock sound itself—Hell's departure had left the band "significantly reduced in fringe aggression".<ref name="W"/>

Other bands were becoming regulars at CBGB, such as [[Mink DeVille]] and [[Talking Heads]], which moved down from Rhode Island. More closely associated with Max's Kansas City were Suicide and the band led by [[Jayne County]], another Mercer Arts Center alumna. The first album to come out of this downtown scene was released in November 1975: Smith's debut, ''[[Horses (album)|Horses]]'', produced by John Cale for the major [[Arista Records|Arista]] label.<ref>Walsh (2006), p. 27.</ref> The inaugural issue of ''Punk'' appeared in December.<ref>Savage (1991), p. 132.</ref> The new magazine tied together earlier artists such as Velvet Underground lead singer [[Lou Reed]], the Stooges, and the New York Dolls with the editors' favorite band, the Dictators, and the array of new acts centered on CBGB and Max's.<ref>Walsh (2006), pp. 15, 24; for ''Punk'', Wayne County, and punk homosexuality, see McNeil and McCain (2006), pp. 272–75; Savage (1992), p. 139; for CBGB's closing in 2006, see, e.g., Damian Fowler, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6054042.stm "Legendary punk club CBGB closes"], [[BBC News]], October 16, 2006.

Early in 1976, Hell left the Heartbreakers; he soon formed a new group that would become known as [[the Voidoids]], "one of the most harshly uncompromising bands" on the scene.<ref>Pareles and Romanowski (1983), p. 249.</ref> That April, the Ramones' debut album was released by [[Sire Records]]; the first single was "[[Blitzkrieg Bop]]", opening with the rally cry "Hey!

Other New York venues apart from CBGB included the Lismar Lounge (41 First Avenue) and Aztec Lounge (9th Street).<ref>''New York'', Volume 20, Page 67 1987 "Lismar Lounge (41 First Avenue, near 3rd Street). The Love Club is no more (it operated in the basement till a month ago). ... When people talk about the punk scene at CBGB, they mean the Sunday matinee performances. For $5 ... Aztec Lounge This is only partly punk—the bar crowd is actually friendly."</ref>

At this early stage, the term ''punk'' applied to the scene in general, not necessarily a particular stylistic approach as it would later—the early New York punk bands represented a broad variety of influences. Among them, the Ramones, the Heartbreakers, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and the Dead Boys were establishing a distinct musical style. Even where they diverged most clearly, in lyrical approach—the Ramones' apparent guilelessness at one extreme, Hell's conscious craft at the other—there was an abrasive attitude in common. Their shared attributes of minimalism and speed, however, had not yet come to define punk rock.<ref>Walsh (2006), p. 8.</ref>

Like their garage rock predecessors, these local scenes were facilitated by enthusiastic impresarios who operated nightclubs or organized concerts in venues such as schools, garages, or warehouses, advertised via inexpensively printed flyers and fanzines.

At the same time, a similar music-based subculture was beginning to take shape in various parts of Australia. A scene was developing around Radio Birdman and its main performance venue, the Oxford Tavern (later the Oxford Funhouse), located in Sydney's [[Darlinghurst]] suburb. In December 1975, the group won the ''RAM (Rock Australia Magazine)''/Levi's Punk Band Thriller competition.<ref>Buckley (2003), p. 3; McFarlane (1999), p. 507.</ref> By 1976, [[The Saints (band)|the Saints]] were hiring Brisbane [[Hall (concept)#Public halls|local halls]] to use as venues, or playing in "Club 76", their shared house in the inner suburb of [[Brisbane central business district|Petrie Terrace]].

<blockquote>
One thing I remember having had a really depressing effect on me was the first Ramones album.

By 1975 the movement was already well established in London and had been growing for a number of years, with non-gigging and recording bands like [[The Flowers of Romance (band)|the Flowers of Romance]] who went on to gain near mythical status. Inspired by music from [[the Velvet Underground]], [[Iggy Pop]] and early [[David Bowie]] at one point the band featured [[Sid Vicious]], [[Marco Pirroni]] and Viv Albertine, who later joined [[the Slits]]. Following a brief period unofficially managing the New York Dolls, Briton [[Malcolm McLaren]] returned to London in May 1975, inspired by the new scene he had witnessed at CBGB. The [[Kings Road]] clothing store he co-owned, recently renamed [[Sex (boutique)|Sex]], was building a reputation with its outrageous "anti-fashion".<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/the-sex-pistols/biography "The Sex Pistols"], ''Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock 'n' Roll'' (2001).

In August, the group was seeking a new lead singer. Another Sex habitué, [[John Lydon|Johnny Rotten]], auditioned for and won the job.

The quote has been incorrectly ascribed to McLaren (e.g., Laing [1985], pp. 97, 127) and Rotten (e.g., [http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A791336 "Punk Music in Britain"], BBC, October 7, 2002), but Savage directly cites the ''[[NME|New Musical Express]]'' issue in which the quote originally appeared. Robb (2006), p. 148, also describes the ''NME'' article in some detail and ascribes the quote to Jones.</ref> The band often provoked its crowds into near-riots. Rotten announced to one audience, "Bet you don't hate us as much as we hate you!"<ref>Quoted in Friedlander and Miller (2006), p. 252.</ref> McLaren envisioned the Sex Pistols as central players in a new youth movement, "hard and tough".<ref>Quoted in Savage (1992), p. 163.</ref> As described by critic [[Jon Savage]], the band members "embodied an attitude into which McLaren fed a new set of references: late-sixties radical politics, sexual fetish material, pop history,...youth sociology".<ref>Savage (1992), p. 163.</ref>

[[Bernard Rhodes]], a sometime associate of McLaren and friend of the Sex Pistols, was similarly aiming to make stars of the band [[London SS]]. Early in 1976, London SS broke up before ever performing publicly, spinning off two new bands: [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]] and [[the Clash]], which was joined by [[Joe Strummer]], former lead singer of the 101'ers.<ref>Savage (1992), pp. 124, 171, 172.</ref> On June 4, 1976, the Sex Pistols played Manchester's [[Free Trade Hall|Lesser Free Trade Hall]] in what came to be regarded as one of the most influential rock shows ever. Among the approximately forty audience members were the two locals who organised the gig—they had formed [[Buzzcocks]] after seeing the Sex Pistols in February. Others in the small crowd went on to form [[Joy Division]], [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]], and—in the 1980s—[[the Smiths]].<ref>{{cite web |date=2006-06-27|title=Sex Pistols Gig: The Truth |publisher=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2006/05/11/110506_sex_pistols_gig_feature.shtml |accessdate=2007-12-29}}</ref>

In July, the Ramones crossed the Atlantic for two London shows that helped spark the nascent UK punk scene and affected its musical style—"instantly nearly every band speeded up".<ref>Taylor (2003), p. 56; McNeil and McCain (2006), pp. 230–233; Robb (2006), pp. 198, 201.

In critic [[Kurt Loder]]'s description, the Sex Pistols purveyed a "calculated, arty [[nihilism]], [while] the Clash were unabashed idealists, proponents of a radical left-wing social critique of a sort that reached back at least to&nbsp;... [[Woody Guthrie]] in the 1940s".<ref>{{cite web |author=[[Loder, Kurt]] |date=2003-03-10|title=The Clash: Ducking Bottles, Asking Questions |publisher=MTV.com |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1470448/20030310/clash.jhtml |accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> The Damned built a reputation as "punk's party boys".{{sfn|Taylor|2004|p=80}} This London scene's first [[fanzine]] appeared a week later.

Its subtitle affirmed the connection with what was happening in New York: "+ Other Rock 'n' Roll Habits for Punks!"{{sfn|Laing|1985|p=13}}

Another Sex Pistols gig in Manchester on July 20, with a reorganized version of Buzzcocks debuting in support, gave further impetus to the scene there.<ref>Cummins, Kevin, "Closer to the Birth of a Music Legend", ''The Observer'', August 8, 2007, p. 12.</ref> In August, the self-described "First European Punk Rock Festival" was held in [[Mont de Marsan]] in the southwest of France. [[Eddie and the Hot Rods]], a London pub rock group, headlined. The Sex Pistols, originally scheduled to play, were dropped by the organizers who said the band had gone "too far" in demanding top billing and certain amenities; the Clash backed out in solidarity. The only band from the new punk movement to appear was the Damned.<ref>Strongman (2008), pp. 131–132; Savage (1992), p. 216. Strongman describes one of the Sex Pistols' objectionable requests as "some entourage accommodation". Savage says they were dropped from the festival following a violent altercation between [[Sid Vicious]], then part of the Sex Pistols' "entourage", and journalist [[Nick Kent]] at a Pistols gig. It is possible that the organizers were specifically afraid of Vicious's attendance.</ref>

Over the next several months, many new punk rock bands formed, often directly inspired by the Sex Pistols.<ref>See, e.g., Marcus (1989), pp. 37, 67.</ref> In London, women were near the center of the scene—among the initial wave of bands were the female-fronted [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] and [[X-Ray Spex]] and the all-female [[the Slits]]. There were female bassists [[Gaye Advert]] in [[the Adverts]] and [[Shanne Bradley]] in [[the Nipple Erectors]].

The band had recently acquired a new bassist, [[Sid Vicious]], who was seen as exemplifying the punk persona.<ref>Colegrave and Sullivan (2005), p. 225.</ref>

Scores of new punk groups formed around the United Kingdom, as far from London as [[Belfast]]'s [[Stiff Little Fingers]] and [[Dunfermline]], Scotland's [[the Skids]]. Though most survived only briefly, perhaps recording a small-label single or two, others set off new trends.

A Ted-aligned band recorded "The Punk Bashing Boogie".<ref>Strongman (2008), pp. 182–84.</ref>

[[Scandinavia]]n punk was propelled early on by tour dates by bands such as the Clash and the Ramones (both in Stockholm in May 1977), and the Sex Pistols' tour through [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] in July the same year. The band [[Andy McCoy|Briard]] jump-started Finnish punk with its November 1977 single "I Really Hate Ya"/"I Want Ya Back"; other early Finnish punk acts included [[Eppu Normaali]] and singer [[Pelle Miljoona]]. The first Swedish punk single was "Vårdad klädsel"/"Förbjudna ljud" released by [[Kriminella Gitarrer]] in February 1978, which started an extensive Swedish punk scene featuring act such as [[Ebba Grön]], [[KSMB (band)|KSMB]], [[Rude Kids]], Besökarna, Liket Lever, Garbochock, [[Attentat (band)|Attentat]], and many others.

By 1979, the [[hardcore punk]] movement was emerging in [[Southern California]]. A rivalry developed between adherents of the new sound and the older punk rock crowd. Hardcore, appealing to a younger, more suburban audience, was perceived by some as anti-intellectual, overly violent, and musically limited. In Los Angeles, the opposing factions were often described as "Hollywood punks" and "beach punks", referring to Hollywood's central position in the original L.A. punk rock scene and to hardcore's popularity in the shoreline communities of [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]] and [[Orange County, California|Orange County]].<ref>Blush (2001), p. 18; Reynolds (2006), p. 211; Spitz and Mullen (2001), pp. 217–32; Stark (2006), "Dissolution" (pp. 91–93); see also, [http://flipsidefanzine.com/PortalHome.html "Round-Table Discussion: Hollywood Vanguard vs. Beach Punks!"] (Flipsidezine.com article archive).</ref>

As hardcore became the dominant punk rock style, many bands of the older California punk rock movement split up, although X went on to mainstream success and [[the Go-Go's]], part of the Hollywood punk scene when they formed in 1978, adopted a pop sound and became major stars.<ref>Spitz and Mullen (2001), pp. 274–79.</ref> Across North America, many other first and second wave punk bands also dissolved, while younger musicians inspired by the movement explored new variations on punk. Some early punk bands transformed into hardcore acts. A few, most notably the Ramones, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers, continued to pursue the style they had helped create. Crossing the lines between "classic" punk, [[post-punk]], and hardcore, San Francisco's [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] was founded in 1979 by former members of Negative Trend and the Sleepers.<ref>See also Reynolds (2005), pp. 208–11.</ref> They became "the reigning kings of American underground rock, for a few years".<ref>Dougan, John.

Radio Birdman broke up in June 1978 while touring the UK,<ref name="M507"/> where the early unity between [[Bohemianism|bohemian]], middle-class punks (many with art school backgrounds) and [[working class|working-class]] punks had disintegrated.<ref>Reynolds (2005), pp. 1–2, 17; Laing (1985), p. 109; Savage (1991), p. 396.</ref> In contrast to North America, more of the bands from the original British punk movement remained active, sustaining extended careers even as their styles evolved and diverged. Meanwhile, the [[Oi!]] and [[anarcho-punk]] movements were emerging. Musically in the same aggressive vein as American hardcore, they addressed different constituencies with overlapping but distinct anti-establishment messages. As described by Dave Laing, "The model for self-proclaimed punk after 1978 derived from the Ramones via the eight-to-the-bar rhythms most characteristic of the Vibrators and Clash.&nbsp;... It became essential to sound one particular way to be recognized as a 'punk band' now."<ref>Laing (1985), p. 108.</ref> In February 1979, former Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious died of a heroin overdose in New York. If the Sex Pistols' breakup the previous year had marked the end of the original UK punk scene and its promise of cultural transformation, for many the death of Vicious signified that it had been doomed from the start.<ref>Savage (1992), p. 530.</ref>

By the turn of the decade, the punk rock movement had split deeply along cultural and musical lines, leaving a variety of derivative scenes and forms. On one side were [[New wave music|new wave]] and post-punk artists; some adopted more accessible musical styles and gained broad popularity, while some turned in more experimental, less commercial directions. On the other side, hardcore punk, Oi!, and anarcho-punk bands became closely linked with underground cultures and spun off an array of [[cross-genre|subgenres]].<ref>Reynolds (2005), p. xvii.</ref> Somewhere in between, [[pop punk]] groups created blends like that of the ideal record, as defined by [[Mekons]] cofounder Kevin Lycett: "a cross between [[ABBA|Abba]] and the Sex Pistols".<ref>Quoted in Wells (2004), p. 21.</ref> A range of other styles emerged, many of them [[Fusion (music)|fusions]] with long-established genres. The Clash album ''[[London Calling]]'', released in December 1979, exemplified the breadth of classic punk's legacy. Combining punk rock with reggae, ska, R&B, and rockabilly, it went on to be acclaimed as one of the best rock records ever.<ref>See, e.g., Spencer, Neil, and James Brown, [http://music.guardian.co.uk/rock/story/0,,1934098,00.html "Why the Clash Are Still Rock Titans"], ''The Observer'' (UK), October 29, 2006.

===New wave===

[[File:Blondie (Debbie Harry) One.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Debbie Harry]] performing in Toronto in 1977]]
In 1976—first in London, then in the United States—"New Wave" was introduced as a complementary label for the formative scenes and groups also known as "punk"; the two terms were essentially interchangeable.<ref>Gendron (2002), pp. 269–74.</ref> ''[[NME]]'' journalist [[Roy Carr]] is credited with proposing the term's use (adopted from the cinematic [[French New Wave]] of the 1960s) in this context.<ref>Strongman (2008), p. 134.</ref> Over time, "new wave" acquired a distinct meaning: Bands such as Blondie and Talking Heads from the CBGB scene; [[the Cars]], who emerged from the Rat in Boston; the Go-Go's in Los Angeles; and the Police in London that were broadening their instrumental palette, incorporating dance-oriented rhythms, and working with more polished production were specifically designated "new wave" and no longer called "punk". Dave Laing suggests that some punk-identified British acts pursued the new wave label in order to avoid radio censorship and make themselves more palatable to concert bookers.<ref>Laing (1985), pp. 37.</ref>

Bringing elements of punk rock music and fashion into more pop-oriented, less "dangerous" styles, new wave artists became very popular on both sides of the Atlantic.<ref>Wojcik (1995), p. 22.</ref> New wave became a catch-all term,<ref>Schild, Matt, [http://www.aversion.com/bands/interviews.cfm?f_id=292 "Stuck in the Future"], Aversion.com, July 11, 2005.

Some bands classified as post-punk, such as [[Throbbing Gristle]] and [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], had been active well before the punk scene coalesced;<ref>Reynolds (2005), p. xxi.</ref> others, such as [[the Slits]] and [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], transitioned from punk rock into post-punk. A few months after the Sex Pistols' breakup, [[John Lydon]] (no longer "Rotten") cofounded [[Public Image Ltd]]. [[Lora Logic]], formerly of X-Ray Spex, founded [[Essential Logic]]. [[Killing Joke]] formed in 1979. These bands were often musically experimental, like certain new wave acts; defining them as "post-punk" was a sound that tended to be less pop and more dark and abrasive—sometimes verging on the [[atonality|atonal]], as with Subway Sect and Wire—and an anti-establishment posture directly related to punk's. Post-punk reflected a range of [[art rock]] influences from [[Captain Beefheart]] to [[David Bowie]] and [[Roxy Music]] to [[Krautrock]] and, once again, the Velvet Underground.<ref name = "Reynolds p4"/>

Post-punk brought together a new fraternity of musicians, journalists, managers, and entrepreneurs; the latter, notably [[Geoff Travis]] of [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]] and [[Tony Wilson]] of [[Factory Records|Factory]], helped to develop the production and distribution infrastructure of the [[independent music|indie music]] scene that blossomed in the mid-1980s.<ref>Reynolds (2005), pp. xxvii, xxix.</ref> Smoothing the edges of their style in the direction of new wave, several post-punk bands such as [[New Order (band)|New Order]] (descended from Joy Division) and [[the Cure]]. crossed over to a mainstream U.S. audience. [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] was one of the formative [[gothic rock]] bands. Others, like Gang of Four, the Raincoats and Throbbing Gristle, who had little more than cult followings at the time, are seen in retrospect as significant influences on modern popular culture.<ref>Reynolds (2005), p. xxix.</ref>

A number of U.S. artists were retrospectively defined as post-punk; Television's debut album ''[[Marquee Moon]]'', released in 1977, is frequently cited as a seminal album in the field.<ref>See, e.g., [http://www.rhapsody.com/television/more.html Television] overview by Mike McGuirk, [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]]; [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r19770|pure_url=yes}} ''Marquee Moon''] review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Allmusic; [http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/t/television-marquee2003.shtml Television: ''Marquee Moon'' (remastered edition)] review by Hunter Felt, [[PopMatters]].

Although most Oi! bands in the initial wave were apolitical or [[left wing]], many of them began to attract a [[white power skinhead]] following.

Anarcho-punk developed alongside the Oi! and American hardcore movements. Inspired by [[Crass]], its [[Dial House, Essex|Dial House]] commune, and its independent [[Crass Records]] label, a scene developed around British bands such as [[Subhumans (British band)|Subhumans]], [[Flux of Pink Indians]], [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]], [[Poison Girls]], and [[the Apostles]] that was concerned as much with anarchist and DIY principles as it was with music. The acts featured ranting vocals, discordant instrumental sounds, primitive production values, and lyrics filled with political and social content, often addressing issues such as class inequalities and military violence.<ref name=G170>Gosling (2004), p. 170.</ref> Anarcho-punk musicians and fans disdained the older punk scene from which theirs had evolved. In historian Tim Gosling's description, they saw "safety pins and Mohicans as little more than ineffectual fashion posturing stimulated by the mainstream media and industry.... Whereas the Sex Pistols would proudly display bad manners and opportunism in their dealings with 'the establishment,' the anarcho-punks kept clear of 'the establishment' altogether".<ref>Gosling (2004), pp. 169–70.</ref>

The movement spun off several subgenres of a similar political bent. [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], founded back in 1977, established [[D-beat]] in the early 1980s. Other groups in the movement, led by [[Amebix]] and [[Antisect]], developed the extreme style known as [[crust punk]]. Several of these bands rooted in anarcho-punk such as [[the Varukers]], Discharge, and Amebix, along with former Oi! groups such as [[the Exploited]] and bands from father afield like Birmingham's [[Charged GBH]], became the leading figures in the [[UK 82]] hardcore movement. The anarcho-punk scene also spawned bands such as [[Napalm Death]], [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]], and [[Extreme Noise Terror]] that in the mid-1980s defined [[grindcore]], incorporating extremely fast tempos and [[death metal]]–style guitarwork.<ref>Purcell (2003), pp. 56–57.</ref> Led by Dead Kennedys, a U.S. anarcho-punk scene developed around such bands as Austin's [[MDC (band)|MDC]] and Southern California's Another Destructive System.<ref>[http://sosrecords.us/label/taxonomy/term/1 News Items].

===Pop punk===
{{Details|Pop punk}}
With their love of [[the Beach Boys]] and late 1960s [[bubblegum pop]], the Ramones paved the way to what became known as pop punk.<ref>Besssman (1993), p. 16; Carson (1979), p. 114; Simpson (2003), p. 72; McNeil (1997), p. 206.</ref> In the late 1970s, UK bands such as [[Buzzcocks]] and [[the Undertones]] combined [[Pop music|pop]]-style tunes and lyrical themes with punk's speed and chaotic edge.<ref>Cooper, Ryan. [http://punkmusic.about.com/od/artistprofiles/p/buzzcocksfinal.htm "The Buzzcocks, Founders of Pop Punk"]. About.com. Retrieved on December 16, 2006.</ref> In the early 1980s, some of the leading bands in Southern California's hardcore punk rock scene emphasized a more melodic approach than was typical of their peers. According to music journalist [[Ben Myers]], [[Bad Religion]] "layered their pissed off, politicized sound with the smoothest of harmonies"; [[Descendents]] "wrote almost surfy, Beach Boys–inspired songs about girls and food and being young(ish)".<ref>Myers (2006), p. 52.</ref> [[Epitaph Records]], founded by [[Brett Gurewitz]] of Bad Religion, was the base for many future pop punk bands. Bands that fused punk with light-hearted pop melodies, such as [[the Queers]] and [[Screeching Weasel]], began appearing around the country, in turn influencing bands like [[Green Day]] and [[the Offspring]], who brought pop punk wide popularity and major record sales. Bands such as [[the Vandals]] and [[Guttermouth]] developed a style blending pop melodies with humorous and offensive lyrics. Eventually, the geographically large midwest U.S. punk scene, anchored largely in places like Chicago and Minneapolis, would spawn bands like [[Dillinger Four]] who would talk a catchy, hooky pop-punk approach and reinfuse it with some of punk's earlier grit and fury, creating a distinctive punk rock sound with a regional tag. This particular substrate still maintains an identity today. The mainstream pop punk of latter-day bands such as [[Blink-182]] is criticized by many punk rock devotees; in critic Christine Di Bella's words, "It's punk taken to its most accessible point, a point where it barely reflects its lineage at all, except in the three-chord song structures."<ref>Di Bella, Christine.

From 1977 on, punk rock crossed lines with many other popular music genres.

Other bands pointed punk rock toward future rock styles or its own foundations. New York's [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]], L.A.'s [[the Screamers]] and [[Nervous Gender]], Australia's [[JAB]], and Germany's [[Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft]] were pioneers of [[electropunk]].

==Legacy and later developments==

===Alternative rock===
{{Main article|Alternative rock}}
The underground punk rock movement inspired countless bands that either evolved from a punk rock sound or brought its outsider spirit to very different kinds of music. The original punk explosion also had a long-term effect on the music industry, spurring the growth of the independent sector.<ref>Laing (1985), pp. 118, 128.</ref> During the early 1980s, British bands like New Order and the Cure that straddled the lines of post-punk and new wave developed both new musical styles and a distinctive industrial niche. Though commercially successful over an extended period, they maintained an underground-style, [[subculture|subcultural]] identity.<ref>Goodlad and Bibby (2007), p. 16.</ref> In the United States, bands such as Hüsker Dü and their Minneapolis protégés [[The Replacements (band)|the Replacements]] bridged the gap between punk rock genres like hardcore and the more melodic, explorative realm of what was then called "[[college rock]]".<ref>Azerrad (2001), passim; for relationship of Hüsker Dü and the Replacements, see pp. 205–6.</ref>

A 1985 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' feature on the Minneapolis scene and innovative California hardcore acts such as Black Flag and Minutemen declared, "Primal punk is passé. The best of the American punk rockers have moved on. They have learned how to play their instruments. They have discovered melody, guitar solos and lyrics that are more than shouted political slogans. Some of them have even discovered the [[Grateful Dead]]."<ref>[http://www.thirdav.com/zinestuff/rs452.html Goldberg, Michael, "Punk Lives"], ''Rolling Stone'', July 18 – August 1, 1985.</ref> By the end of the 1980s, these bands, who had largely eclipsed their punk rock forebears in popularity, were classified broadly as [[alternative rock]]. Alternative rock encompasses a diverse set of styles—including [[gothic rock]] and [[grunge]], among others—unified by their debt to punk rock and their origins outside of the musical mainstream.<ref name=Erlewine>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/09/23/showbiz/music/nirvana-nevermind/index.html |title=American Alternative Rock/Post-Punk|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=2011-11-07}}</ref>

===Heavy metal===
{{Main article|Heavy metal music}}
In the beginning, the [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] created by [[Judas Priest]] was music of slow tempos and little aggression. When punk rock exploded in '77 in the music scene mainstream, many bands like [[Motörhead]] (pioneer NWOBHM) combine the dense sound of heavy metal with dirt and speed of punk rock creating a new movement called [[New wave of British heavy metal]] where many bands were influenced by many punk bands like [[Sex Pistols]], [[the Damned (band)|the Damned]] and [[Ramones]], among other bands. From this new style of heavy metal, they grew others even more aggressive styles but always influenced by punk rock, like [[Speed metal]] (much influenced by punk rock and NWOBHM), [[Thrash metal]] (influenced by [[hardcore punk]] and speed metal), [[Death metal]] (which combined the thrash metal and [[D-beat]]) and [[Black metal]] (influenced by death metal and [[Horror punk]]).

===Queercore===

In the 1990s, the queercore movement developed around a number of punk bands with gay, lesbian, bisexual, or genderqueer members such as [[God Is My Co-Pilot (band)|God Is My Co-Pilot]], [[Pansy Division]], [[Team Dresch]], and [[Sister George]]. Inspired by openly gay punk musicians of an earlier generation such as [[Jayne County]], [[Phranc]], and [[Randy Turner]], and bands like [[Nervous Gender]], [[the Screamers]], and [[Coil (band)|Coil]], queercore embraces a variety of punk and other alternative music styles. Queercore lyrics often treat the themes of prejudice, [[sexual identity]], [[gender identity]], and individual rights. The movement has continued into the 21st century, supported by festivals such as [[Queeruption]].<ref>Spencer (2005), pp. 279–89.</ref>

By the 1990s, punk rock was sufficiently ingrained in Western culture that punk trappings were often used to market highly commercial bands as "rebels". Marketers capitalized on the style and hipness of punk rock to such an extent that a 1993 ad campaign for an automobile, the [[Subaru Impreza]], claimed that the car was "like punk rock".<ref>Klein (2000), p. 300.</ref> Along with Nirvana, many of the leading grunge artists of the early 1990s acknowledged the influence of earlier punk rock acts.

The effect of commercialization on the music became an increasingly contentious issue.

Since 1993, [[Anti-Flag]] had been putting progressive politics at the center of its music. The administration of [[George W.
