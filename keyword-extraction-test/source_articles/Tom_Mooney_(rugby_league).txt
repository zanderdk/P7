'''Tom Mooney''' (born 16 March 1952) is an Australian former professional [[rugby league]] footballer of the 1970s. He played in [[Sydney]]'s [[New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership]] as a [[Rugby league positions#Wing|winger]] for the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah]] and [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]] clubs. Mooney won the 1976 and 1978 premierships with Manly.

==Career==
Born in  in [[Coffs Harbour]], [[New South Wales]], Mooney was a junior winger for [[Wauchope, New South Wales|Wauchope]]. He joined South Sydney in [[1972 NSWRFL season|1972]]. He played three seasons with the Rabbitohs before joining Manly-Warringah in [[1975 NSWRFL season|1975]]. At the end of the [[1976 NSWRFL season]] Mooney played in Manly's [[Grand Final]]-winning side which defeated [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] 13-10. He was also the 1976 season's top try-scorer, equal with team mate and Manly's captain [[Bob Fulton]] with both scoring 18 tries in the regular season, though Fulton would score another 3 tries in the finals series.

Mooney scored a try in the [[1978 NSWRFL season]]'s Grand Final against [[Cronulla Sharks|Cronulla-Sutherland]], which was drawn 11-all and had to be re-played just three days later. Manly would go on to win the replay 16-0 though Mooney did not cross for a try.<ref>[http://rugbyleagueproject.com/players/Tom_Mooney.html Tom Mooney] rugbyleagueproject.com</ref> After playing in Manly's premiership team, Mooney was considered unlucky not to gain a place on the [[1978 Kangaroo tour|1978]] [[Kangaroo Tour]]. Seven of his team mates did tour, as did Manly coach [[Frank Stanton (rugby league)|Frank Stanton]] who was the head coach of the Kangaroos.

Tom Mooney would also go on to be the [[1979 NSWRFL season]]'s top try scorer.<ref>Alan Whiticker. Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players. 2005</ref>

In 1990 Mooney was named on the wing in a Manly team made up of the best players in the [[History of the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|club's history]]. He was one of the few exceptional players that failed to represent either his state or country.

Former Manly team mate [[Paul Vautin|Paul "Fatty" Vautin]] told in his biography ''"The Strife and Times of Paul Vautin'' that during the [[1981 NSWRFL season]], Mooney was considered to be in a form slump after not having scored a try in the first six games of the season (of which Manly had only won two). Before Manly's Round 7 match against South Sydney at Manly's home ground [[Brookvale Oval]], a fired up Mooney all but ordered team mates to get him the ball during the game. Mooney went on to score two tries as the Sea Eagles won 21-13. Ironically it would be another 10 games before he crossed for another try. He scored a total of 9 tries for the season and retired from playing at the end of the year.
