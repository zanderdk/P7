'''Hooking''' in [[ice hockey]] is a penalty. The NHL covers hooking in Rule 55, which defines it as "the act of using the stick in a manner that enables a player or goalkeeper to restrain an opponent." The NHL groups hooking with other "Restraining fouls" such as holding, interference and tripping.[1]

==Hooking in the rules==

The NHL covers hooking in Rule 55, which defines it as "the act of using the stick in a manner that enables a player or goalkeeper to restrain an opponent." It goes on to specify that "when a player is checking another in such a way that there is only stick-to-stick contact, such action is not to be penalized as hooking." The NHL groups hooking with other "Restraining fouls" such as [[holding (ice hockey)|holding]], [[interference (ice hockey)|interference]] and [[tripping (ice hockey)|tripping]].<ref>NHL Rulebook, Rule 55: http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26347 Accessed 3/6/10</ref>

The [[IIHF]] covers hooking in Rule 533, defining a player guilty of hooking as one "who impedes or seeks to impede the progress of an opponent by hooking him with the stick." <ref>IIHF Rulebook, Section 5: http://www.iihf.com/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF/rules_part_two.pdf Accessed 3/6/10</ref>

Both codes allow for hooking to be penalized with either a [[Penalty (ice hockey)#Minor penalty|minor]] or [[Penalty (ice hockey)#Major penalty|major]] penalty; the latter is imposed for injuring an opponent by hooking, and carries with it an automatic [[Penalty (ice hockey)#Game misconduct penalty|game misconduct]].

==Emphasis in NHL==

Following the [[2004-2005 NHL lockout]], then NHL made "Zero tolerance on Interference, Hooking and Holding/Obstruction" its top priority for game officials.<ref>Collective Bargaining Agreement FAQ, NHL.com: http://www.nhl.com/nhlhq/cba/rules_changes072205.html Accessed 3/6/10</ref> Since that time the league and its officials have made a significant effort to follow up on that priority, and the game is being played in a more open style as a result.
