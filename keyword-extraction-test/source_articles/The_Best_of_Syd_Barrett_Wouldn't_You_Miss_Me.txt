'''''The Best of Syd Barrett: Wouldn't You Miss Me?''''' is a [[compilation album]] by [[Syd Barrett]] released in 2001 that spans Barrett's entire solo career.

==Content==
Comprising highlights from [[Syd Barrett]]'s two 1970 albums ''[[The Madcap Laughs]]'' (seven songs),<ref name=AM/> ''[[Barrett (album)|Barrett]]'' (nine songs),<ref name=AM/> and the 1988 out-takes collection ''[[Opel (album)|Opel]]'' (four songs),<ref name=AM/> the album was issued to service casual Barrett fans who presumably would only require one disc of his music.

As a bonus to dedicated Barrett followers, ''The Best of Syd Barrett: Wouldn't You Miss Me?'' includes "Two of a Kind", from Barrett's [[John Peel]] radio show performance in February 1970,<ref name=AM/> and, courtesy of [[David Gilmour]]'s personal collection,<ref name=MCLM13-14>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Malcolm|title=The Making of The Madcap Laughs|year=2003|publisher=Brain Damage|edition=21st Anniversary|pages=13–14}}</ref> Barrett's previously-unreleased "[[Bob Dylan Blues]]",<ref name=AM/> an original recorded a few days after "Two of a Kind",<ref name=MCLM13-14/><ref name=B2010_2>{{cite AV media notes|title=Barrett|titlelink=Barrett (album)|others=Syd Barrett|year=[[Harvest]]|page=2|type=booklet|publisher=[[EMI]]}}</ref> that before this release was a very rare and sought-after song.
