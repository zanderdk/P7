In the game, [[Mario]] explores [[Princess Peach]]'s castle and must rescue her from [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]. As one of the earlier [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] (3D) platform games, ''Super Mario 64'' is based on [[open world]] playability, [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] through all [[Axis (mathematics)#Cartesian coordinates in three dimensions|three axes]] in space, and relatively large areas which are composed primarily of [[3D computer graphics|true 3D]] [[polygon]]s as opposed to only [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] (2D) [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]]. The game established a new archetype for the 3D genre, much as ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' did for 2D sidescrolling platformers. In the evolution from two dimensions to three, ''Super Mario 64'' places an emphasis on exploration within vast worlds that require the player to complete multiple diverse missions, in addition to the occasional linear obstacle courses as in traditional platform games. While doing so, it still preserves many gameplay elements and characters of earlier ''Mario'' games.<ref name="1up1"/>

The game has left a lasting impression on 3D game design, particularly notable for its use of a dynamic [[Virtual camera system|camera system]] and the implementation of its 360-degree analog control.<ref name="1up1">{{cite web| url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3135350 |title = The Essential 50 Part 36: Super Mario 64 | publisher=[[1UP.com]]| accessdate=October 21, 2006}}</ref><ref name="gamespotinf">{{cite web|url= http://www.gamespot.com/wii/action/supermario64/review.html?|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090307030507/http://www.gamespot.com/wii/action/supermario64/review.html?|archivedate= 2009-03-07 |title=15 Most Influential Games of All Time | publisher=[[GameSpot]]| accessdate=July 3, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/091/091398p1.html | title=N64 Reader Tributes: Super Mario 64 | publisher=IGN| accessdate=October 21, 2006}}</ref> The title is acclaimed by many critics and fans as one of the greatest and most revolutionary video games of all time.<ref name="IGN100-2003">{{cite web| url=http://top100.ign.com/2003/1-10.html| archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5mqeaoEzJ| archivedate=2010-01-17| title=IGN's Top 100 Games| publisher=IGN| year=2003| accessdate=February 2, 2008}}</ref><ref name="IGN100-2005">{{cite web| url=http://top100.ign.com/2005/001-010.html| archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5mqeao0AV| archivedate=2010-01-17| title=IGN's Top 100 Games| publisher=IGN| year=2005| accessdate=February 11, 2006}}</ref><ref name="IGN100-2007">{{cite web| url=http://top100.ign.com/2007/ign_top_game_5.html| archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65aWDgKEP| archivedate=2012-02-20| title=IGN's Top 100 Games of All Time| publisher=IGN| year=2007| accessdate=February 2, 2008}}</ref><ref name="GI100">{{Cite journal| date= August 2001| title= Top 100 Games of All Time| journal= [[Game Informer]]| page= 36}}</ref><ref name="yahoo100">{{cite web| url = http://uk.videogames.games.yahoo.com/specials/100games/1.html| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/65aWJH4fd| archivedate = 2012-02-20| title = The 100 Greatest Computer Games of All Time| publisher = [[Yahoo!

==Gameplay==
[[File:N64 Super Mario 64 whomp fortress.jpg|thumb|left|Courses like Whomp's Fortress require the player to navigate chasms]]
''Super Mario 64'' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[platform game|platformer]] where the player controls [[Mario]] through several courses. Each course is an enclosed world in which the player is free to wander in all directions and discover the environment without time limits. The worlds are filled with enemies that attack Mario, as well as friendly creatures that provide assistance, offer information, or ask a favor (such as pink "peace-loving" Bob-omb Buddies). The player gathers stars in each course; some stars only appear after completing certain tasks, often hinted at by the name of the course. These challenges include defeating a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]], solving puzzles, racing an opponent, and gathering coins. As more stars are collected, more areas of the castle hub world become accessible.<ref name="NP88">{{Cite journal| date= September 1996| title= Full Coverage&nbsp;— Super Mario 64| journal= [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher= [[Nintendo]]| issue= 88| pages= 14–23}}</ref><ref name="playersguide"/> The player unlocks doors in the castle with keys obtained by defeating Bowser in special courses.<ref name="playersguide"/> There are many hidden mini-courses and other secrets to the game, most containing extra stars required for the full completion of the game.

There are three special cap power-ups appear in certain areas on many stages. The Wing Cap allows Mario to fly; the Metal Cap makes him immune to most damage, allows him to withstand wind, walk underwater, and be unaffected by noxious gases; and the Vanish Cap renders him partially immaterial and allows him to walk through some obstacles such as wire mesh, as well as granting invulnerability to some forms of damage.<ref name="playersguide"/> Some courses contain [[cannon]]s that Mario can access by speaking to a pink [[Bob-omb Buddy]]. After entering a cannon, Mario can be shot out to reach distant places. When the player has the Wing Cap equipped, cannons can be used to reach high altitudes or fly across most levels quickly.

Mario's abilities in ''Super Mario 64'' are far more diverse than those of previous ''Mario'' games. The player can make Mario walk, run, jump, crouch, crawl, swim, climb, kick, or punch using the [[game controller]]'s [[analog stick]] and buttons. Special jumps can be executed by combining a regular jump with other actions, including the double and triple jumps (jumping two and three times in a row, respectively), long jump and [[Somersault|backflip]]. There are also special maneuvers, such as [[wall jump]]ing—jumping from one wall to another in rapid succession to reach areas that would otherwise be too high.<ref name="playersguide"/><ref name="instructions"/> The player can pick up and carry certain items, an ability which is used to solve various puzzles, and swim underwater at various speeds. Mario's life energy slowly diminishes while underwater, representing how long he can hold his breath.<ref name="NP88"/><ref name="playersguide"/>

==Plot and setting==
''Super Mario 64'' is set in [[Princess Peach's Castle]], which consists of three floors, a basement, a moat, and a courtyard. The area outside the castle is an introductory area in which the player can experiment, testing his or her player skills. Scattered throughout the castle are entrances to courses via secret walls and paintings.<ref name="NP88"/> ''Super Mario 64'' begins with a letter from [[Princess Peach]] inviting Mario to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for him.<ref>'''Princess Peach's note''': "Dear Mario: Please come to the castle. I've baked a cake for you. Yours truly-- Princess Toadstool, ''Peach''." {{cite video game| title = Super Mario 64| developer = [[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development|Nintendo EAD]]| publisher = Nintendo | date= September 29, 1996| platform= Nintendo 64}}</ref> However, when he arrives, Mario discovers that [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] has invaded the castle and imprisoned the princess and her servants within it using the power of the castle's 120 Power Stars. Many of the castle's paintings are portals to other worlds, in which Bowser's minions keep watch over the stars. Mario explores the castle for these portals to enter the worlds and recover the stars. He gains access to more rooms as he recovers more Power Stars, and eventually traverses three different obstacle courses, each leading to its own battle with Bowser. Defeating Bowser the first two times earns Mario a key for opening another level of the castle. After Mario defeats Bowser in the final battle, Peach is released from the [[Stained glass|stained-glass window]] above the castle's entrance. Peach rewards Mario by kissing him on the nose and baking the cake that she had promised him.<ref name="playersguide">{{cite book|year=1996|title=Official Super Mario 64 Player's Guide|publisher=Nintendo}}</ref><ref name="instructions">{{cite book| year=1996|title=Super Mario 64 Instruction Booklet| publisher=Nintendo| id=NUS-NSME-USA}}</ref><ref>'''Princess Peach''': "Mario!

==Development==

===Concept===
The development of ''Super Mario 64'' took less than two years during the development of the Nintendo 64 gaming system and the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] era, but producer and director [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] stated that he had conceived of a 3D ''Mario'' game concept more than five years prior, while working on ''[[Star Fox (video game)|Star Fox]]''.<ref name="Miyamoto Interview, NP 80"/> He considered utilizing the [[Super FX]] chip in order to develop a proposed [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] game to be called ''Super Mario FX'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.cheats.ign.com/objects/142/14217644.html |title=IGN: Super Mario FX |publisher=Uk.cheats.ign.com |date=September 13, 2010 |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}</ref> but instead retargeted the idea to the Nintendo 64.  This was not due to the former system's technical limitations, but because the N64 controller has more buttons for gameplay.<ref name="IGN100-2007"/><ref name=nsider>{{cite web| url=http://www.n-sider.com/contentview.php?contentid=223| title=Profile: Shigeru Miyamoto Chronicles of a Visionary| publisher=N-Sider| author=Grajqevci, Jeton| date=October 9, 2000| accessdate=December 5, 2007}}</ref> According to former Argonaut engineer [[Q-Games|Dylan Cuthbert]], a game titled ''Super Mario FX'' had never reached development status, and that "Super Mario FX" had been used as the internal code name of the Super FX chip itself.<ref name="Dylan Cuthbert Super Mario FX">{{cite web | title=Dylan Cuthbert | url=https://twitter.com/dylancuthbert/statuses/165596909413728256 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525211908/https://twitter.com/dylancuthbert/statuses/165596909413728256 | archivedate=May 25, 2014 | publisher=Twitter | accessdate=May 25, 2014 | quote=SNES Central @dylancuthbert I'm researching unreleased SNES games, was a game called "Super Mario FX" ever in development? Dylan Cuthbert @snescentral no, that was the internal code name for the FX chip" }}</ref>

According to [[Jez San]], the ultimate design of ''Super Mario 64'' was influenced by a prototype of [[Argonaut Software]]'s cancelled 3D platform game starring [[Yoshi]] that later became ''[[Croc: Legend of the Gobbos]]''.<ref name="croc">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-07-04-born-slippy-the-making-of-star-fox|title=Born slippy: the making of Star Fox|last=McFerran|first=Damien|date=4 July 2013|work=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=4 July 2013}}</ref>

===Design===
The game's development began with the creation of the characters and [[Virtual camera system|camera system]]. Miyamoto and the other designers were initially unsure of which direction the game should take; months were spent selecting a camera view and layout that would be appropriate.<ref name="goddard interview">{{Cite journal|date=December 2001|title=The Making of Mario 64: Giles Goddard Interview|journal=[[NGC Magazine]]|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|issue=61|others=[http://pixelatron.com/blog/the-making-of-super-mario-64-full-giles-goddard-interview-ngc/ Full interview]}}</ref> The original concept involved the game having fixed path much like an [[isometric projection|isometric]] type game (similar to ''[[Super Mario RPG]]''), before the choice was made to settle on a free-roaming 3D design.<ref name="goddard interview"/> Although the majority of ''Super Mario 64'' would end up featuring the free-roaming design, elements of the original fixed path concept would remain in certain parts of the game, particularly in the three Bowser encounters. One of the programmers of ''Super Mario 64'', Giles Goddard, explained that these few linear elements survived as a means to force players into Bowser's lair rather than to encourage exploration.<ref name="goddard interview"/>

The development team placed high priority on getting Mario's movements right, and before levels were created, the team was testing and refining Mario's animations on a simple grid. The first test scenario for controls and physics involved Mario interacting with a golden rabbit named "MIPS" for the Nintendo 64's [[MIPS architecture]] CPU, who was included in the final release of the game. The developers initially tried to make the game split screen co-op using both Mario and Luigi. Initially, the two characters would start at separate points in the castle and work their way through the game together. However, developers were unable to make the gameplay work.<ref name="destructoid-mario">{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/mario-64-once-had-a-co-op-mode-156090.phtml |title=Mario 64 once had a co-op mode |publisher=Destructoid |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}</ref>

One unique challenge that the team encountered early on was related to depth perception, which the team remedied by provisioning a shadow directly beneath each object regardless of the area's lighting.  Developer [[Yoshiaki Koizumi]] would go on to call this feature an "iron-clad necessity" which "might not be realistic, but it’s much easier to play."<ref>{{cite web|date=27 Nov 2007|title=MIGS 2007: Nintendo's Koizumi On The Path From Garden To Galaxy  |work=Gamasutra|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=16386#.UERP19ZlRWw|accessdate=2 Sep 2012}}</ref>

Miyamoto's guiding design philosophy behind ''Super Mario 64'' was to "include more details" than found in games prior to the Nintendo 64, featuring "an entire world in miniature, like miniature trains" with "all the emotions of the characters". Some details were inspired by the developers' personal lives. For example, the [[Boo (character)|Boo]]s are based on assistant director [[Takashi Tezuka]]'s wife, who, as Miyamoto explained, "is very quiet normally, but one day she exploded, maddened by all the time Tezuka spent at work. In the game, there is now a character which shrinks when Mario looks at it, but when Mario turns away, it will grow large and menacing."<ref name="Miyamoto Interview, NP 80">{{Cite interview | date=January 1996| title=The Game Guys - (Shoshinkai 1995)| first1=Shigeru | last1=Miyamoto | first2=Takashi | last2=Tezuka | journal=[[Nintendo Power]]| publisher=[[Nintendo]]| issue=80 | url=http://www.zeldalegends.net/index.php?n=interviews&id=1996-01-np080-miya-tezu&m=html | accessdate=May 25, 2014}}</ref>

''Super Mario 64'' features more puzzles than earlier ''Mario'' games. It was developed simultaneously with ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'', but as ''Ocarina of Time'' was released more than two years later, some puzzles were taken from that game for ''Super Mario 64''. Information about ''Super Mario 64'' first leaked out in November 1995, and a playable version of the game was presented days later as part of the world premiere for the Nintendo 64 (then known as the "Ultra 64") at [[Nintendo Space World]]. At this point, the basic controls had been implemented and the game was reportedly 50% finished, featuring 32 courses, although about 2% of mapping was complete. Miyamoto thought he could create more courses, up to 40 plus bonus levels. However, the actual number turned out much lower in the final game, as only 15 courses could fit.<ref name="Miyamoto Interview, NP 80"/> According to Nintendo of America chairman [[Howard Lincoln]], Miyamoto's desire to put more into ''Super Mario 64'' was a major factor in the decision to push the Nintendo 64's release date back from Christmas 1995 to April 1996.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Nintendo's Lincoln Speaks Out on the Ultra 64! |journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=78|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=January 1996|pages=74–75}}</ref>

The music was composed by veteran composer [[Koji Kondo]], who created new interpretations of the familiar melodies from earlier games as well as entirely new material. ''Super Mario 64'' is one of the first games in the series to feature [[Charles Martinet]] as the voice of [[Mario]]. It also features the voices of Leslie Swan (then Senior Editor of ''[[Nintendo Power]]'') as [[Princess Peach]], who also wrote the English text for the game.<ref name="NP89-2">{{Cite journal| date= October 1996| title = Super Mario 64| journal= [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher= [[Nintendo]]| issue= 89| page= 67}}</ref>

''Super Mario 64'' is the first game to have a "free" camera that can be controlled independently of the character.<ref name="GWR08-2"/> Most 3D games from the time use a [[first-person shooter|first-person]] perspective, or a camera that is fixed in position relative to the player's character, or to the level.

At the time, 3D games generally allowed for controls in which the player could either control the character in relation to a fixed camera angle or in relation to the character's perspective. ''Super Mario 64''{{'}}s controls are fully analog, and interpret a 360-degree range of motion into navigation through a 3D space relative to the camera. The analog stick also allows for precise control over subtleties such as the speed at which Mario runs.

Because of the game's popularity, rumors about glitches and secrets spread rapidly after its release. A common rumor was that [[Luigi]] was a secret character in the game, fueled by illegible symbols in the castle courtyard that were said to resemble the text "L is real 2401". This same texture would reappear in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'' on a plaque in Dodongo's Cavern.
