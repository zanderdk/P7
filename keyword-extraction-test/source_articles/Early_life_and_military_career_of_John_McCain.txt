The early life and military career of [[John McCain|John Sidney McCain III]] spans the first forty-five years of his life (1936–1981). [[John S. McCain Jr.|McCain's father]] and [[John S. McCain Sr.|grandfather]] were [[Admiral (United States)|admirals]] in the [[United States Navy]]. McCain was born on August 29, 1936, in the [[Panama Canal Zone]], and attended many schools growing up as his family moved among naval facilities.  McCain graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy]] in 1958.  He married the former [[Carol McCain|Carol Shepp]] in 1965; he adopted two children from her previous marriage and they had another child together.

As a [[United States Naval Aviator|naval aviator]], McCain flew [[attack aircraft]] from [[aircraft carrier|carriers]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], he narrowly escaped death in the [[1967 USS Forrestal fire|1967 ''Forrestal'' fire]]. On his twenty-third <!--NB this article intentionally uses words instead of numerals for numbers like this, as permitted by [[WP:MOSNUM#Numbers as figures or words]], both for formality and to avoid awkward numeral expressions later on--> bombing mission in October 1967, he was shot down over [[Hanoi]] and badly injured. He subsequently endured five and a half years as a [[prisoner of war]], including periods of torture. In 1968, he refused a [[North Vietnam]]ese offer of early release, because it would have meant leaving before other prisoners who had been held longer. He was released in 1973 after the [[Paris Peace Accords]].

Upon his return, McCain studied at the [[National War College]], commanded a large training squadron in Florida, and was appointed the Navy liaison to the U.S. Senate. He divorced his wife Carol in 1980 and married the former [[Cindy McCain|Cindy Hensley]] shortly thereafter. He retired from the Navy in 1981 as a [[Captain (United States O-6)|captain]].

Recognized as belonging in the latter category, I soon found myself in conflict with the Academy's authorities and traditions.

McCain and other prisoners were moved around to different camps at times, but conditions over the next several years were generally more tolerable than they had been before.<ref name="usnwr73"/> Unbeknownst to them, each year that Jack McCain was CINCPAC, he paid a Christmastime visit to the American troops in [[South Vietnam]] serving closest to the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]]; he would stand alone and look north, to be as close to his son as he could get.<ref name="ff-287">McCain, ''Faith of My Fathers'', pp. 287–88. McCain states that he has received dozens of reports over the years of his father doing this.</ref> By 1971, some 30–50&nbsp;percent of the POWs had become disillusioned about the war, both because of the apparent lack of military progress and what they heard of the growing anti-war movement in the U.S., and some of them were less reluctant to make propaganda statements for the North Vietnamese.<ref name="hub-549">Hubbell, ''P.O.W.'', pp. 548–49.</ref> McCain was not among them: he participated in a defiant church service<ref>Timberg, ''An American Odyssey'', p. 104.</ref> and led an effort to write letters home that only portrayed the camp in a negative light,<ref>Rochester and Kiley, ''Honor Bound'', p. 537.</ref> and as a result spent much of the year in a camp reserved for "bad attitude" cases.<ref name="hub-549"/>

Altogether, McCain was held as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for five and a half years, nearly five of them after his refusal to accept the out-of-sequence repatriation offer.
