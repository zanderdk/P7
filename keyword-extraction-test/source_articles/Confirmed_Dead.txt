== Plot ==

The episode's five flashbacks focus on the reactions and activities of the freighter's crew who made contact with the Oceanic 815 survivors; [[Daniel Faraday]] ([[Jeremy Davies]]) is shown crying while watching a newscast confirming the deaths of all Oceanic 815 passengers. His caretaker asks why he is crying, and he answers that he does not know. [[Miles Straume]] ([[Ken Leung]]) is a [[mediumship|medium]] hired by an elderly woman to remove the ghost of her grandson from her home. After conversing with the spirit, Miles finds a hidden cache of money and drugs.

[[Frank Lapidus]] ([[Jeff Fahey]]) is an alcoholic who was originally scheduled to pilot flight 815. He phones the Oceanic hotline while watching the newscast and claims that the footage of the plane wreckage being aired on television is not authentic, while [[Naomi Dorrit]] ([[Marsha Thomason]]) is shown in a posthumous flashback, criticizing her employer [[Characters of Lost#Minor recurring off-island characters|Matthew Abaddon]] ([[Lance Reddick]]) for his choice in her coworkers.<ref name="episode">[[Drew Goddard|Goddard, Drew]] (writer) & [[Brian K.

This shot was not intended to use effects; however, "it's impossible to get a toy plane to spiral the way you want it to", according to supervisor Mitch Suskin.  A tank with still water and rocks on the bottom was filmed and the plane was added in editing.  Suskin said that creating effects for "Confirmed Dead" "was slightly too leisurely" because the episode aired over four months after post-production began.<ref>Raugust, Karen, (March 4, 2008) "[http://vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=3568 ''Lost'': Season 4&nbsp;– VFX Interrupts]", VFXWorld.
