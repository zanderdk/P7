The '''Harden Family Cemetery''' is a historic cemetery in rural [[Chicot County, Arkansas]].  It is located in a horse pasture off Hardin Road, north of the hamlet of [[Jennie, Arkansas|Jennie]], which is on [[Arkansas Highway 13]] south of [[Lake Village, Arkansas|Lake Village]].  The small family cemetery, which is not visible from the road, contains fourteen marked graves, dating from 1892 to the 1960s.  All are for members of the Harden family, who were an African-American family prominent in the life of the small community, and among the earliest of their race to settle the area.  The patriarch of the family, John Harden, Sr., was a freed slave who died in 1892.  One grandson was a local pastor, another was a schoolteacher.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansaspreservation.com/!userfiles/CH0178.nr.pdf|title=NRHP nomination for Harden Family Cemetery|publisher=Arkansas Preservation|accessdate=2014-04-05}}</ref>
