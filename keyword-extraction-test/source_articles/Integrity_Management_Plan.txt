'''Integrity Management Plan''' (part of an [[asset integrity management systems|asset integrity management system]]) is a documented and systematic approach to ensure the long-term integrity of an asset or assets.<ref>{{cite book| title=AS2885 Pipelines - Gas and liquid petroleum Part 3| publisher=Standards Australia| date=2012| isbn=978 1 74342 214 4}}</ref>  Integrity management planning is a process for assessing and mitigating risks in an effort to reduce both the likelihood and consequences of incidents.  The Integrity Management Plan (IMP) forms a part of the overall asset integrity management system and is audited as per the [[Integrity Engineering Audit]] (IEA).

Particularly post the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]], the role of asset integrity has never been more critical to the global oil and gas business. Not only can a well-managed asset integrity plan help operators identify and reduce safety risks before they escalate but focusing on asset integrity can also play a major role in both achieving operational excellence and extending the life of ageing assets.

Asset integrity plans are maintained and reviewed regularly so that they: 
*Optimizes operational and capital expenditures
*Ensures adoption of best-in-class practices
*Assists management of risk
*Increases shareholder, senior management, regulator and public confidence
*Identifying risks, conducting assessments, taking preventive actions and implementing mitigate measures 

An effective IMP should contain:
*A process outline – Details the process envelope (temperature pressure and velocity) in which the system operates and any critical parameters that must be followed.  Also states process chemistry and contaminants that are encountered.
*A threat identification list- Information about the asset segments are evaluated to identify the threats of concerns to the asset and to assess risk.
*A Risk Analysis – A systematic process, in which potential hazards from facility operation are identified, and the likelihood and consequences of potential adverse events are estimated.  
*Detailed Regulatory Requirements –details the applicable regulatory standards to be met and the methods used to comply with those standards.
*A [[Responsibility assignment matrix]] – Details the persons responsible, accountable for any tasks to comply with the requirements of the plan.  It also states those who should be communicated to and Informed.
*Corrosion circuits – showing the system broken down into corrosion circuits shows damage mechanisms, materials of construction and process chemistry.
*Damage frequency (statistics) rates of decay
*Critical operating parameters for process safety
*Mitigation techniques, frequency, condition monitoring, inspections and process monitoring requirements.
*Historic review of asset condition to-date.
*Knowledge gap analysis, missing information, manufacturer's data report (MDR), review drawings etc.
*Previous failure analysis review.
*Design drawing review, materials of construction (initial).
*Management of change review, alterations and repairs carried out. 
*Remediation – Repairs techniques considered.

Also
*Record keeping.
*Performance plan.
*Communication plan.
*Regular Interaction.
*Management of change.
*Prevention and Mitigation measures.
*How to conduct assessments / frequency / audit of system.
