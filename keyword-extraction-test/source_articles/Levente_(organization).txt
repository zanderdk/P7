'''Levente Associations''' ({{lang-hu|Levente Egyesületek}}) or simply ''"levente"''<ref>''"Levente"'' is an [[Old Hungarian language|Old Hungarian]] word for "[[knight]]; see also "[[Levente]]" 
</ref> were [[paramilitary]] [[youth organization]]s in [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]] in the [[Hungary between the World Wars|interwar period]] and [[Hungary during the Second World War|during the Second World War]]. It was established in 1921 with the declared purpose of physical and health training.<ref name=OT/> Since mid-1930s they have de facto become an attempt to circumvent  the ban for [[conscription]] imposed by the [[Treaty of Trianon#Miscellaneous consequences|Treaty of Trianon]] and over the time it had openly become a pre-military organization under the leadership of [[veteran]]s.<ref>Ernst Christian Helmreich (1957) "Hungary", ''[[Praeger Publishers|Praeger]]'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=GPohAAAAMAAJ&q=levente+youth&dq=levente+youth&lr=&ei=0Gi_R6HXDJ6MjAHineX0Aw&pgis=1 p. 45]</ref><ref name=horvath/> Since 1939, by the Act of Defense, all boys of ages 12–21 were required to take part in ''levente''.<ref name=horvath>Attila Horvath, "War and Peace: the Effects of the World War II on Hungarian Education" in: Roy Lowe (ed.) (1992) "Education & the Second World War: Studies in Schooling & Social Change", ISBN 0-7507-0054-8</ref>

It is usually compared to [[Hitler Jugend]] of [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Opera Nazionale Balilla]] of [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]. While having a common trait of military training with the latter two, ''levente'' was neither openly [[fascist]] nor particularly politicized, although it was not isolated of political influences of the time.<ref name=horvath/>

Levente had also a smaller female branch, initiated as a voluntary association in June 1942. [[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|Under the rule]] of [[Ferenc Szálasi]] [[Operation Panzerfaust|installed by Nazis]] in Hungary in October 1944 obligatory ''levente'' duties were imposed unto girls of ages 12–19 despite the strong opposition of the [[Catholic Church]]. However the latter was not actually implemented because of the advance of the [[Red Army]].<ref name=horvath/>

By the end of [[World War II]] ''Levente'' members  had to actually serve in auxiliary forces.

[[Soviet occupation of Hungary|During the Soviet occupation]] many ''levente'' activists were tried by Soviet tribunals, convicted of "[[anti-Soviet]] activities" and [[Forced labor of Hungarians in the Soviet Union|deported to the Soviet Union for penal labor]].
