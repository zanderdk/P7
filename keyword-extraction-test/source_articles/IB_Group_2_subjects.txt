The '''Group 2: Language acquisition''' (previously Second Language) subjects of the [[IB Diploma Programme]] consist of the nearly 80 [[foreign language|additional languages]] offered and may be studied at the following levels: B (SL or HL), or ab initio (SL only).<ref name=autogenerated3>[[#refSchoolGuideDP2002|Schools' Guide to IBDP]], p. 10.</ref> [[Latin]] and [[history of the Greek language|Classical Greek]] are also offered and may be taken at SL or HL.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> To earn an IB Diploma, a candidate must study an additional language, though a second [[IB Group 1 subjects|Language A]] may be taken instead of studying that language as a Group 2 subject.<ref name=autogenerated3 />

== Language ''ab initio'' SL==
If a student has no previous background in a given language, then that student may study that language as an ''[[ab initio]]'' SL subject. Such a course focuses on giving the student basic knowledge of both the language in everyday use and the culture of the places where it is spoken. The standard reached by the student after two years is considerably lower than that reached in language B.

;Curriculum
For students to achieve communicative competence in a variety of situations, the following core topics are explored in the Language ''ab initio'' course: the individual, education and work, town and services, food and drink, leisure and travel, the environment, health and emergencies.
The language skills that are taught and assessed are: listening, reading, writing, speaking and cultural awareness.<ref>[[#refLangBSG2002|Language ab initio subject guide 2002]], p. 13.</ref>

;Assessment
''Internal Assessment'' — (30% of total grade) for a Language ''ab initio'' consists of the average of two oral presentations, one of which is to be given to the teacher, recorded and sent out for moderation. The other is an interactive oral activity and can be individual or group.<ref name=autogenerated1>[[#refLangBSG2002|Language ab initio subject guide 2002]], p. 28.</ref>

''External Assessment'' — (70% of total grade) for Language ''ab initio'' includes paper 1, consisting of 3–4 reading comprehension texts and paper 2, consisting of one short writing task and one extended-response writing task.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

For the oral and written components of the assessments, students receive marks based on their level of competency in use of language, presentation and communication skills.<ref name=autogenerated2>[[#refLangBSG2002|Language ab initio subject guide 2002]], p. 39.</ref>

For reading comprehension, students receive a grade based on a markscheme (answer key) for questions that are multiple-choice, short-answer, true/false/justify, matching and extended response.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

== Language A2 SL and HL==
The Language A2 is no longer offered by IB and integrated to Group 1 Language A.<ref>[http://www.ibo.org/diploma/curriculum/group2/ IB Diploma Programme curriculum, group 2: second language]</ref> Language A2 corresponded to a near-[[native language|native]] level of [[fluency]] in the [[foreign language]], and as such concentrated less on studying the actual language and more on the [[literature]] and [[culture]] of the countries where the language is spoken.

;Curriculum
The Languages A2 were studied through ''Cultural Options'' and ''Literary Options'', both of which must be included by the [[teacher]] in the two-year IB course. Study at the A2 level was available in a significantly lower number of languages than at other levels. Many [[bilingual]] institutions supplemented their regular curriculum with an English A2 certification.

;Assessment
''Internal Assessment'' — for Language A2 consisted of two oral components, in the same way as for [[IB Group 1 subjects|language A1]].

''External Assessment'' —for Language A2 consisted of paper 1, the ''Comparative Commentary'', where the students write a commentary that compares the two previously unseen texts that appear in the exam. Paper 2 is an essay on either a Cultural or a Literary Option. In addition, students produced two ''Written Tasks'' of 1000–1500 words total to be assessed externally by the [[International Baccalaureate|IB]] examiners.
