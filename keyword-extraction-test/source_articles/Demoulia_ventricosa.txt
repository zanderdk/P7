'''''Demoulia ventricosa''''', common name : the '''blunt demoulia''',  is a [[species]] of [[sea snail]], a marine [[gastropod]] [[mollusk]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Nassariidae]], the Nassa mud snails or dog whelks.<ref name="WoRMS">Gofas, S. (2015). Demoulia ventricosa. In: MolluscaBase (2015). Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=553033 on 2016-05-15</ref>

There is one subspecies: ''Demoulia ventricosa nataliae'' <small>Kilburn, 1972</small>

==Description==
The shell size varies between 17 mm and 27 mm

The ovate shell is slightly cylindrical and is blunted at its summit. The short [[Spire (mollusc)|spire]] is flattened. It is composed of five [[Whorl (mollusc)|whorl]]s. The two last whorls are much more swollen, and covered upon their whole surface with very fine and very close transverse striae. The suture is very apparent, and a little canaliculated. The white [[Aperture (mollusc)|aperture]] is ovate, narrowed at its upper part and dilated inferiorly. The outer [[Lip (gastropod)|lip]] is thin and is ornamented interiorly with numerous transverse striae. The smooth [[Columella (gastropod)|columella]] is arcuated at its base and is covered throughout its whole length with the inner lip, the base of which is a little thicker. The surface of this shell is reddish or violet-colored, with wide, reddish spots. It is ornamented at the upper part of the whorls, and along the suture, with a white band, alternating with irregular deeper spots. <ref name="Kiener">[http://ia801409.us.archive.org/6/items/generalspeciesic00kien/generalspeciesic00kien.pdf Kiener (1840).
