The '''Boeing 777''' is a family of [[Long-haul|long-range]] [[Wide-body aircraft|wide-body]] [[Twinjet|twin-engine]] [[jet airliner]]s developed and manufactured by [[Boeing Commercial Airplanes]]. It is the world's largest [[twinjet]] and has a typical seating capacity for 314 to 451 passengers, with a [[Range (aircraft)|range]] of {{convert|5235|to|9500|nmi|km|lk=in}}.

As Boeing's first [[fly-by-wire]] airliner, it has computer-mediated controls. It was also the first commercial aircraft to be designed entirely with [[computer-aided design]].

The 777 is produced in two fuselage lengths {{As of|2014|lc=y}}. The original 777-200 variant entered commercial service in 1995, followed by the extended-range 777-200ER in 1997. The stretched 777-300, which is {{convert|33.25|ft|abbr=on|adj=on|sigfig=3}} longer, followed in 1998. The initial 777-200, -200ER and -300 versions are equipped with [[General Electric GE90]], [[Pratt & Whitney PW4000]], or [[Rolls-Royce Trent 800]] engines. The extended-range 777-300ER and ultra long-range 777-200LR variants entered service in 2004 and 2006 respectively, while the 777F, a [[Cargo aircraft|freighter]] version, debuted in February 2009; these variants all feature high-output GE90 engines and extended [[Wingtip device#raked wingtip|raked wingtips]]. The 777-200LR is the world's longest-range airliner, able to fly more than halfway around the globe, and holds the record for the longest distance [[Non-stop flight|flown non-stop]] by a commercial aircraft.<ref name=guinness/><ref name=NYT_772LR_record/>

The 777 first entered commercial service with [[United Airlines]] on June 7, 1995. It has received more orders than any other wide-body airliner; as of July 2016, 60 customers<!--The unidentified customers are grouped as one by Boeing. JAL Domestic and International air counted as one--> had placed orders for 1,893 aircraft of all variants, with 1,417 delivered.<ref name=777_O_D_summ/> The most common and successful variant is the 777-300ER<ref name="centreforaviation.com">{{cite web|url=http://centreforaviation.com/analysis/777-300er-fleet-report-orders-have-peaked-but-swiss-united-and-kuwait-new-operators-in-2016-268001|title=777-300ER fleet report: orders have peaked but Swiss, United and Kuwait new operators in 2016 - CAPA - Centre for Aviation|work=centreforaviation.com|accessdate=September 6, 2016}}</ref> with 665 delivered and 800 orders;<ref name=777_O_D_summ/> [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] operates the largest 777 fleet, with 157 passenger and freighter aircraft as of July 2016.<ref name=FI16>{{cite web |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/asset/12798 |title= World Airliner Census |date= 2016 |publisher= FlightGlobal}}</ref> The 777 has been involved in six [[hull loss]]es as of August 2016; the [[Asiana Airlines Flight 214]] accident in July 2013 was its first fatal crash in 18 years of service.

The 777 ranks as one of Boeing's best-selling models. Airlines have acquired the type as a comparatively [[Fuel efficiency|fuel-efficient]] alternative to other wide-body jets and have increasingly deployed the aircraft on long-haul transoceanic routes. Direct market competitors include the [[Airbus A330|Airbus A330-300]], newly launched [[Airbus A350 XWB]], and the out-of-production [[Airbus A340|A340]] and [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]]. The [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787 Dreamliner]], which entered service in 2011, shares design features with the 777. In November 2013, Boeing announced the development of upgraded 777-8 and 777-9 variants, collectively named [[Boeing 777X|777X]], featuring composite wings and GE9X engines and further technologies developed for the 787. The 777X series is planned to enter service by 2020.

==Development==

===Background===
In the early 1970s, the [[Boeing 747]], [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], and the [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar]] became the first generation of [[Wide-body aircraft|wide-body passenger airliners]] to enter service.<ref name=wells>{{Harvnb|Wells|Rodrigues|2004|p=146}}</ref> In 1978, [[Boeing]] unveiled three new models: the twin-engine [[Boeing 757]] to replace its venerable [[Boeing 727|727]], the twin-engine [[Boeing 767|767]] to challenge the [[Airbus A300]], and a [[trijet]] 777 concept to compete with the DC-10 and L-1011.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946981,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118220221/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946981,00.html |archivedate=2007-11-18 |title=The 1980s Generation |work=Time |date=August 14, 1978 |accessdate=July 19, 2008}}</ref><ref name=inside777>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/19/business/new-boeing-airliner-shaped-by-the-airlines.html |title=New Boeing Airliner Shaped by the Airlines |date=December 19, 1990 |last=Weiner |first=Eric |work=The New York Times |accessdate=May 8, 2011}}</ref><ref name="Eden98-03">{{Harvnb|Eden|2008|pp=98, 102–103}}</ref> The mid-size 757 and 767 launched to market success, due in part to 1980s' extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards ([[ETOPS]]) regulations governing transoceanic twinjet operations.<ref name="eden99">{{Harvnb|Eden|2008|pp=99–104}}</ref> These regulations allowed twin-engine airliners to make ocean crossings at up to three hours' distance from emergency [[Diversion airport|diversionary airport]]s.<ref name="Norris and Wagner 1999, p. 128">{{Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=128}}</ref> Under ETOPS rules, airlines began operating the 767 on long-distance overseas routes that did not require the capacity of larger airliners.<ref name=eden99/> The trijet 777 was later dropped, following marketing studies that favored the 757 and 767 variants.<ref>{{Harvnb|Yenne|2002|p=33}}</ref> Boeing was left with a size and range gap in its product line between the [[Boeing 767|767-300ER]] and the [[Boeing 747-400|747-400]].<ref name=Eden112>{{Harvnb|Eden|2008|p=112}}</ref>

By the late 1980s, DC-10 and L-1011 models were approaching retirement age, prompting manufacturers to develop replacement designs.<ref name=norris126>{{Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=126}}</ref> McDonnell Douglas was working on the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11|MD-11]], a stretched and upgraded successor of the DC-10,<ref name=norris126/> while Airbus was developing its A330 and A340.<ref name=norris126/> In 1986, Boeing unveiled proposals for an enlarged 767, tentatively named 767-X,<ref name=norris127>{{Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=127}}</ref> to target the replacement market for first-generation wide-bodies such as the DC-10,<ref name="Norris and Wagner 1999, p. 128"/> and to complement existing 767 and 747 models in the company lineup.<ref name=Eden106>{{Harvnb|Eden|2008|p=106}}</ref> The initial proposal featured a longer fuselage and larger wings than the existing 767,<ref name=norris127/> along with [[winglet]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=11}}</ref> Later plans expanded the fuselage cross-section but retained the existing 767 [[Cockpit|flight deck]], nose, and other elements.<ref name=norris127/>

Airline customers were unimpressed with the 767-X proposals, and instead wanted an even wider fuselage cross-section, fully flexible interior configurations, short- to intercontinental-range capability, and an [[operating cost]] lower than any 767 stretch.<ref name="Norris and Wagner 1999, p. 128"/> Airline planners' requirements for larger aircraft had become increasingly specific, adding to the heightened competition among aircraft manufacturers.<ref name=norris126/> By 1988, Boeing realized that the only answer was a new design, which became the 777 twinjet.<ref>{{Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1996|pp=9–14}}</ref> The company opted for the twin-engine configuration given past design successes, projected engine developments, and reduced-cost benefits.<ref>{{Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=129}}</ref> On December 8, 1989, Boeing began issuing offers to airlines for the 777.<ref name=norris127/>

The design phase for the new twinjet was different from Boeing's previous commercial jetliners. For the first time, eight major airlines – [[All Nippon Airways]], [[American Airlines]], [[British Airways]], [[Cathay Pacific]], [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Japan Airlines]], [[Qantas]], and [[United Airlines]] – had a role in the development.<ref name="Birtles_777_p13">{{Harvnb|Birtles|1998|pp=13–16}}</ref> This was a departure from industry practice, where manufacturers typically designed aircraft with minimal customer input.<ref name=inside777/> The eight airlines that contributed to the design process became known within Boeing as the "Working Together" group.<ref name="Birtles_777_p13"/> At the first group meeting in January 1990, a 23-page questionnaire was distributed to the airlines, asking what each wanted in the design.<ref name="Norris and Wagner 1999, p. 128"/> By March 1990, Boeing and the airlines had decided upon a basic design configuration: a cabin cross-section close to the 747's, capacity up to 325 passengers, flexible interiors, a [[glass cockpit]], [[fly-by-wire]] controls, and 10&nbsp;percent better [[Available seat miles|seat-mile costs]] than the A330 and MD-11.<ref name="Norris and Wagner 1999, p. 128"/> Boeing selected its [[Boeing Everett Factory|Everett factory]] in Washington, home of 747 production, as the 777's final assembly site.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lane |first=Polly |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19911201&slug=1320330 |title=Aerospace Company May Be Rethinking Commitment To The Puget Sound Area |work=[[Seattle Times]] |date=December 1, 1991 |accessdate=October 15, 2009}}</ref>

On October 14, 1990, United Airlines became the 777's launch customer when it placed an order for 34 [[Pratt & Whitney]]-powered aircraft valued at US$11&nbsp;billion with [[Option (aircraft purchasing)|options]] on an additional 34.<ref name="norris132"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,971474,00.html |title=Business Notes: Aircraft |work=Time |date=October 29, 1990 |accessdate=July 19, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118220227/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,971474,00.html |archivedate=2007-11-18}}</ref> The development phase coincided with United's replacement program for its aging DC-10s.<ref name=wagner14>{{Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1996|p=14}}</ref> United required that the new aircraft be capable of flying three different routes: Chicago to Hawaii, Chicago to Europe, and non-stop from [[Denver]], a [[hot and high]] airport, to Hawaii.<ref name=wagner14/> ETOPS certification was also a priority for United,<ref>{{Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1996|p=13}}</ref> given the overwater portion of United's Hawaii routes.<ref name="norris132">{{Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=132}}</ref> In January 1993, a team of United developers joined other airline teams and Boeing designers at the Everett factory.<ref>{{Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1996|p=15}}</ref> The 240 design teams, with up to 40 members each, addressed almost 1,500 design issues with individual aircraft components.<ref>{{Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1996|p=20}}</ref> The fuselage diameter was increased to suit Cathay Pacific, the baseline model grew longer for All Nippon Airways, and British Airways' input led to added built-in testing and interior flexibility,<ref name="Norris and Wagner 1999, p. 128"/> along with higher operating weight options.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-64618874.html |title=BA Gets New 777 Model |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=February 10, 1997 |accessdate=2015-07-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105222755/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-64618874.html |archivedate=2012-11-05}}</ref>

GE will improve the fan module and the high pressure compressor stage-1 [[blisk]] in the GE-90-115 turbofan, as well as reduce clearances between the tips of the turbine blades and the shroud during cruise.  These improvements, of which the latter is the most important and was derived from work to develop the [[Boeing 787|787]], will, GE says, lower fuel burn by 0.5%.  Boeing's wing modification will deliver the remainder. Boeing stated that every 1% improvement in the 777-300ER's fuel burn translates into being able to fly the aircraft another 75 nautical miles on the same load of fuel, or add ten passengers or 2,400&nbsp;lb of cargo to a "load limited" flight.<ref>Norris, Guy. "Mind the gap". Aviation Week & Space Technology, February 16 - March 1, 2015, pp. 42-3.</ref>

In March 2015, additional details of the improvement package were published in Aviation Week & Space Technology.  The 777-300ER is to shed 1,800 lb.  Boeing will replace the fuselage crown with tie rods and composite integration panels, similar to those used on the 787. New flight control software is to eliminate the need for the tail skid by keeping the tail off the runway surface regardless of the extent to which pilots command the elevators.  Boeing is also redesigning the inboard flap fairings to reduce drag by reducing pressure on the underside of the wing. The outboard raked wingtip is to have a divergent trailing edge, described as a"poor man's airfoil" by Boeing; this originally developed for the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-12]] project.  Another change involves elevator trim bias.  These changes are to increase fuel efficiency and allow airlines to add 14 additional seats to the airplane, increasing per seat fuel efficiency by 5%.<ref>Norris, Guy. "Sharpened edge". Aviation Week & Space Technology, March 16–29, 2015, pp. 26-8.</ref>

In January 2016, Boeing confirmed plans to reduce the production rate of the 777 family from 8.3/mo to 7/mo in 2017 to help close the production gap between the 777 and 777X created by a lack of new orders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airwaysnews.com/blog/2016/01/27/777-production-rate/|title=Boeing to Trim 777 Production, to Boost 737 Build Rate|date=January 27, 2016|work=airwaysnews.com|accessdate=September 6, 2016}}</ref>

Boeing uses two characteristics &ndash; [[fuselage]] length and [[Range (aircraft)|range]] &ndash; to define its 777 models.<ref name=Eden112/> Fuselage length affects the number of passengers and amount of cargo that can be carried; the 777-200 and derivatives are the base size, and the aircraft was stretched into the 777-300 in 1998. In terms of range, the aircraft has been categorized into three segments based on design criteria. The A-market would cover domestic and regional operations, the B-market would cover routes from Europe to the US West coast and the C-market the longest transpacific routes.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Magic of a Name: The Rolls-Royce Story, Part 3: A Family of Engines |author= Peter Pugh |publisher= Icon Books Ltd |isbn= 9781848319981 |date= 2002 |url= https://books.google.fr/books?id=LtXGBwAAQBAJ&lpg=PT205&dq=boeing%20777%20routes%20market&hl=fr&pg=PT205#v=onepage&q=boeing%20777%20routes%20market&f=false }}</ref>

These were initially defined as the following:
* A-market: up to {{convert|4200|nmi|km}}<ref name="Birtles_756-67-77_p103-05">{{Harvnb|Birtles|1999|pp=103, 105}}</ref>
* B-market: {{convert|6600|nmi|km}}<ref name="Birtles_756-67-77_p103-05"/>
* C-market: {{convert|7800|nmi|km}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=102}}</ref>

When referring to different variants, Boeing and airlines often collapse the model number (777) and the variant designator (-200 or -300) into a truncated form (e.g., "772" or "773"<ref name=IATAcode>{{cite web |url=http://www.jal.co.jp/en/5971/readme/ships_info.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125064415/http://www.jal.co.jp/en/5971/readme/ships_info.html |archivedate=2009-11-25 |title=About our operating aircraft |work=Japan Airlines|accessdate=October 25, 2009}}</ref>). The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) aircraft type designator system adds a preceding manufacturer letter (e.g., "B772" or "B773").<ref name=ICAOcode/> Subsequent to the capacity number, designations may or may not append the range identifier (e.g., 777-300ER as "773ER",<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/air-nz-must-ask-shareholders/2007/09/11/1189276720074.html |title=Air NZ must ask shareholders |work=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=March 30, 2009 |last=John |first=Danny |date=September 12, 2007}}</ref> "773B",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China_Business/GL03Cb06.html |title= Cathay Pacific puts its trust in Boeing |publisher=[[Asia Times Online]] |accessdate=March 30, 2009 |date=December 3, 2005}}</ref> "77W",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aircanada.com/en/about/fleet/77W.html|title=Air Canada – 777-300ER (77W)|work=Air Canada|accessdate=March 30, 2009}}</ref> or "B77W"<ref name=ICAOcode/>).
