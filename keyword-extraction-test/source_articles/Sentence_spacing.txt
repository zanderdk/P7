'''Sentence spacing''' is the horizontal [[Space (punctuation)|space]] between sentences in [[typeset]] [[Written language|text]]. It is a matter of typographical [[convention (norm)|convention]].<ref>[[#Chi03|University of Chicago Press 2003, ''Chicago Manual of Style'']]. p.&nbsp;243; [[#Ein06|Einsohn 2006]]. p.&nbsp;113; [[#Shu89|Shushan and Wright 1989]]. p.&nbsp;34.</ref> Since the introduction of [[movable type|movable-type]] printing in Europe, various sentence spacing conventions have been used in languages with a [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]].<ref>Languages with Sanscrit, Cyrillic, cuneiform, hieroglyphics, Chinese, and Japanese characters, among others, are not covered in the scope of this article. Handwriting is also not covered.</ref> These include a normal [[word space]] (as between the words in a sentence), a single enlarged [[Space (punctuation)|space]], and two full spaces.

Until the 20th century, publishing houses and printers in many countries used additional space between sentences. There were exceptions to this traditional spacing method—some printers used spacing between sentences that was no wider than word spacing.<ref name="Felici 2009"/> This was ''[[History of sentence spacing#French and English spacing|French spacing]]''—a term synonymous with single-space sentence spacing until the late 20th century.<ref>In the 1990s, some print and Web sources began referring to double sentence spacing as "French spacing", leading to some ambiguity with the term. See for example, [[#Eck94|Eckersley et al. 1994]]. p.&nbsp;46, and [[#Hal06|Haley 2006]].</ref> With the introduction of the [[typewriter]] in the late 19th&nbsp;century, typists used two spaces between sentences to mimic the style used by traditional typesetters.<ref name="Bringhurst 2004. p.28">[[#Bri04|Bringhurst 2004]]. p.&nbsp;28.</ref> While wide sentence spacing was phased out in the printing industry in the mid-twentieth century, the practice continued on typewriters<ref name="Felici 2003. p.80">[[#Fel03|Felici 2003]]. p.&nbsp;80</ref> and later on computers.<ref name="Jury">[[#Jur09|Jury 2009]]. p.&nbsp;58</ref> Perhaps because of this, many modern sources now incorrectly<ref name="Felici 2009">[[#Fel09|Felici 2009]]</ref> claim that wide spacing was created for the typewriter.<ref name="blametypewriter">[[#Jur09|Jury 2009]]. p.&nbsp;57; [[#Wil03|Williams 2003]]. p.&nbsp;13; [[#Fog08|Fogarty 2008]]. p.&nbsp;85</ref>

The desired or correct sentence spacing is often debated but many sources now say additional space is not necessary or desirable.<ref>[[#Fel03|Felici 2003]]. p.&nbsp;80; [[#Fog08|Fogarty 2008]]. p.&nbsp;85; [[#Jur09|Jury 2009]]. p.&nbsp;56; [[#Str10|Strizver 2010]]; [[#Wal04|Walsh 2004]]. p.&nbsp;3; [[#Wil03|Williams 2003]]. pp.&nbsp;13–14.</ref> From around 1950, single sentence spacing became standard in books, magazines and newspapers,<ref>[[#Wil03|Williams 2003]]. pp.&nbsp;13–14. This refers to professionally published works, as it is possible for individual authors to publish works through desktop publishing systems. Williams states, "I guarantee this: never in your life have you read professionally set text printed since 1942 that used two spaces after each [[Full stop|period]]."

The debate continues on the [[World Wide Web]].<ref name="Felici 2009"/>  Many people prefer double sentence spacing for informal use because that was how they were taught to type.<ref name="Strizver 2010">[[#Str10|Strizver 2010]].</ref> There is a debate on which convention is more [[readability|readable]]; the few recent direct [[#Studies|studies]] conducted since 2002 have produced inconclusive results.<ref>[[#Llo09|Lloyd and Hallahan 2009]]. "During times when many disciplines that recommend the APA's Publication Manual [6th ed., 2009] are advocating evidence-based decisions, it's noteworthy, we think, that these discussions of the rationale for using two spaces at the end of sentences (and after colons) do not appear to be based on scientific examination of the hypothesis that two spaces makes manuscripts more readable."</ref>

==History==
{{Main article|History of sentence spacing}}

===Traditional typesetting===
[[Image:German text example - Em sentence spaced - 1907.jpg|thumb|350px|Widely spaced sentences in typeset text with, at minimum, an em-space between sentences (1909)]]

Shortly after the invention of movable type, highly variable spacing was created that could create spaces of any size, and allowed for perfectly even justification.<ref>[[#DeV01|DeVinne 1901]]. p.&nbsp;142.</ref> Early American, English, and other European typesetters' style guides (also known as ''printers' rules'') specified spacing standards that were all essentially identical from the 18th century onwards. These guides—e.g., Jacobi in the UK (1890)<ref>[[#Jac90|Jacobi 1890]].</ref> and MacKellar, Harpel, and De Vinne (1866–1901) in the U.S.<ref>[[#Mac85|MacKellar 1885]]; [[#Har70|Harpel 1870]]. p.&nbsp;19; [[#DeV01|DeVinne 1901]]. p.&nbsp;78.</ref>—indicated that sentences should be [[Em (typography)|em]]-spaced, and that words should be 1/3 or 1/2 em-spaced (illustration right). The relative size of the sentence spacing would vary depending on the size of the word spaces and the justification needs.<ref>[[#Chi11|Chicago University Press 1911]]. p.&nbsp;101. Variable-spaced text (professionally typeset) is unlikely to result in a sentence space exactly twice the size of a word space (which can be seen with a typewriter or monospaced font). Variables such as whether a 1/3 or 1/2 word space is used, and whether the text is justified or unjustified, will vary the difference between a sentence space and word space.</ref> For most countries, this remained the standard for published work until the 20th century.<ref>[[#Fel09|Felici 2009]]. Felici illustrates that there are other examples of standard single word spaces used for sentence spacing in this period.</ref> Yet, even in this period, there were publishing houses (notably in France) that used a standard word space between sentences—a technique called French spacing (illustration below).

===Mechanical type and the advent of the typewriter===
Mechanical type systems introduced near the end of the 19th century, such as the Linotype and Monotype machines, allowed for some variable sentence spacing similar to hand composition.<ref>[[#Dod06|Dodd 2006]]. p.&nbsp;73; [[#Mer40|Mergenthaler Linotype 1940]].</ref> Just as these machines revolutionized the mass production of text, the advent of the typewriter around the same time revolutionized the creation of personal and business documents. But the typewriters' mechanical limitations did not allow variable spacing—typists could only choose the number of times they pressed the space bar. Typists in some English-speaking countries initially learned to insert three spaces between sentences<ref name="Wid14">[[#Wid14|One or two spaces after a period? How about three?]]</ref> to approximate the wider sentence spacing used in traditional printing, but later settled on two spaces,<ref>[[#Jur09|Jury 2009]]. p.&nbsp;58. This primarily refers to the United States and Great Britain.</ref> a practice that continued throughout the 20th century.<ref name="Bringhurst 2004. p.28"/> This became known as English spacing, and marked a divergence from French typists, who continued to use French spacing.<ref>[[#Imp93|Imprimerie nationale 1993]].</ref>
[[Image:Example of french-spaced text - 1874.jpg|left|thumb|French spaced typeset text (1874)]]

===Transition to single spacing===
In the early 20th century, some printers began using one and a half interword spaces (an "[[en quad]]") to separate sentences.<ref>[[#Osg19|Osgood 1919]]</ref> This standard continued in use, to some extent, into the 1990s.<ref name="Adams 1996">[[#Ada96|Adams, et al. 1996]]. p.&nbsp;24. Adams, Faux, and Rieber say, "For most composition, the em quad is used to indent the first line of a paragraph, the en quad is used to separate sentences, and the 3-em space is placed between words." An en is half an em and a 3-em space is a third of an em, so the space between sentences would be 1.5 times the space between words.</ref>

Magazines, newspapers, and books began to adopt the single space convention in the United States in the 1940s and in the United Kingdom in the 1950s.<ref>[[#Fel09|Felici 2009]]; [[#Chi09|University of Chicago Press 2009]]; [[#Wil03|Williams 2003]]. p.&nbsp;14.</ref> Typists did not move to single spacing simultaneously. The average writer still relied on the typewriter to create text—with its inherent mechanical spacing limitations.

Technological advances began affecting sentence spacing methods. In 1941, [[IBM]] introduced the [[IBM Electric typewriter#Executive|Executive]], a typewriter capable of proportional spacing<ref name="wer254">[[#Wer05|Wershler-Henry 2005]]. pp.&nbsp;254–255.</ref>—which had been used in professional typesetting for hundreds of years. This innovation broke the hold that the monospaced font had on the typewriter—reducing the severity of its mechanical limitations.<ref name="wer254"/> By the 1960s, electronic phototypesetting systems ignored runs of white space in text.<ref name="Felici 2009"/> This was also true of the [[World Wide Web]], as [[HTML]] normally ignores additional spacing,<ref>[[#Lup04|Lupton 2004]]. p.&nbsp;165. HTML normally ignores all additional horizontal spacing between text.</ref><ref name="tomweb">[http://www.tomsarazac.com/tom/opinions/space-after-periods.html#web How many spaces at the end of a sentence? One or two?]</ref> although in 2011 the [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] 2.1 standard officially added an option that can preserve additional spaces.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cascading Style Sheets Level 2 Revision 1 (CSS 2.1) Specification |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/text.html#white-space-prop |date=7 June 2011 |at=16.6 |quote=pre-wrap: This value prevents user agents from collapsing sequences of white space.}}</ref> In the 1980s, desktop publishing software provided the average writer with more advanced formatting tools.<ref>[[#Jur09|Jury 2009]]. p.&nbsp;57.</ref> By the late 20th century, literature on the written word had begun to adjust its guidance on sentence spacing.

==Modern literature==

===Typography===
Early positions on [[typography]] (the "arrangement and appearance of text")<ref>[[#Ame07|American Medical Association 2007]]. p.&nbsp;917.</ref> supported traditional spacing techniques in English publications. In 1954, Geoffrey Dowding's book, ''Finer Points in the Spacing and Arrangement of Type'', underscored the widespread shift from a single enlarged em space to a standard word space between sentences.<ref>[[#Dow95|Dowding 1995]].</ref>

With the advent of the computer age, typographers began [[Deprecation|deprecating]] double spacing, even in monospaced text. In 1989, ''Desktop Publishing by Design'' stated that "[[typesetting]] requires only one space after periods, question marks, exclamation points, and colons", and identified single sentence spacing as a typographic convention.<ref>[[#Shu89|Shushan and Wright 1989]]. p.&nbsp;34.</ref> ''Stop Stealing Sheep & Find Out How Type Works'' (1993) and ''Designing with Type: The Essential Guide to Typography'' (2006) both indicate that uniform spacing should be used between words, including between sentences.<ref>[[#Cra06|Craig 2006]]. p.&nbsp;90; [[#Spi93|Spiekermann and Ginger 1993]], p.&nbsp;123.</ref>

More recent works on typography weigh in strongly. Ilene Strizver, founder of the Type Studio, says, "Forget about tolerating differences of opinion: typographically speaking, typing two spaces before the start of a new sentence is absolutely, unequivocally wrong."<ref name="Strizver 2010"/> The ''Complete Manual on Typography'' (2003) states that "The typewriter tradition of separating sentences with two word spaces after a period has no place in typesetting" and the single space is "standard typographic practice".<ref>[[#Fel03|Felici 2003]]. pp.&nbsp;80–81.</ref> The ''Elements of Typographic Style'' (2004) advocates a single space between sentences, noting that "your typing as well as your typesetting will benefit from unlearning this quaint [double spacing] Victorian habit."<ref name="Bringhurst 2004. p.28"/>

David Jury's book, ''About Face: Reviving the Rules of Typography'' (2004)—published in Switzerland—clarifies the contemporary typographic position on sentence spacing:

<blockquote>Word spaces, preceding or following punctuation, should be optically adjusted to appear to be of the same value as a standard word space. If a standard word space is inserted after a full point or a comma, then, optically, this produces a space of up to 50% wider than that of other word spaces within a line of type. This is because these punctuation marks carry space ''above'' them, which, when added to the adjacent standard word spaces, combines to create a visually larger space. Some argue that the "additional" space after a comma and full point serves as a "pause signal" for the reader. But this is unnecessary (and visually disruptive) since the pause signal is provided by the punctuation mark itself.<ref>[[#Jur04|Jury 2004]]. p.&nbsp;92.</ref></blockquote>

===Style and language guides===
{{Main article|Sentence spacing in language and style guides}}
[[Image:Traditional spacing examples digitalized from the 1911 Chicago Manual of Style.png|right|thumb|250px|Traditional spacing examples from the 1911 ''Chicago Manual of Style'']]

====Style guides====
Early [[style guide]]s for typesetting used a wider space between sentences than between words – "traditional spacing", as shown in the illustration to the right.<ref>[[#DeV01|De Vinne 1901]]; [[#Chi11|University of Chicago Press 1911]]; [[#Har93|Hart 1893]].</ref> During the 20th century, style guides commonly mandated two spaces between sentences for typewritten [[manuscripts]], which were used prior to professionally typesetting the work.<ref>[[#Gar06|Garner, Newman and Jackson 2006]]; "So I ask you [authors]: space twice after every period", Nina K. Hoffman, "Typesetters Blues", in [[#SFWA|Rusch and Smith 1990]], p.&nbsp;113.</ref> As computer [[desktop publishing]] became commonplace, typewritten manuscripts became less relevant and most style guides stopped making distinctions between manuscripts and final typeset products.<ref>For example, the 15th Edition of the Chicago Manual of Style states that "A single character space, not two spaces, should be left after periods at the ends of sentences (both in manuscript and in final, published form) and after colons. [[#Chi03|University of Chicago Press 2003 Chicago Manual of Style]]. p.&nbsp;61.</ref> In the same period, style guides began changing their guidance on sentence spacing. The 1969 edition of the ''Chicago Manual of Style'' used em spaces between sentences in its text;<ref>[[#Chi69|University of Chicago Press 1969 ''Manual of Style'']] (commonly referred to as the ''Chicago Manual of Style'', and titled thus in recent editions (first edition published in 1906.) The 1969 edition of the ''Manual of Style'' shows em spacing after sentences in the manuscript example (page 41), but single spacing in the typset example (p.&nbsp;73).</ref> by the 2003 edition it had changed to single sentence spacing for both manuscript and print. By the 1980s, the United Kingdom's ''Hart's Rules'' (1983)<ref>[[#Har83|Hart 1983]]</ref> had shifted to single sentence spacing. Other style guides followed suit in the 1990s.<ref>[[#Ame97|American Sociological Association]].</ref> Soon after the beginning of the 21st century, the majority of style guides had changed to indicate that only one word space was proper between sentences.<ref name="Fogarty2008">[[#Fog08|Fogarty 2008]]. p.&nbsp;85; [[#Leo09|Leonard, et al. 2009]].</ref>

Modern style guides provide standards and guidance for the written language. These works are important to writers since "virtually all professional editors work closely with one of them in editing a manuscript for publication."<ref>[[#Lut05|Lutz and Stevenson 2005]]. p.&nbsp;viii.</ref> Late editions of comprehensive style guides, such as the [[Style guide#United Kingdom|''Oxford Style Manual'']] (2003)<ref>[[#Rit03|Ritter 2003]]. The 2003 edition of the ''Oxford Style Manual'' combined the ''Oxford Guide to Style'' (first published as ''Horace Hart's Rules for Compositors and Readers at the University Press, Oxford'' in 1893) and the ''Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors'' (first published as the ''Authors' and Printers' Dictionary'' in 1905) Preface.</ref> in the United Kingdom and ''[[the Chicago Manual of Style]]'' (2010)<ref>[[#Chi10|University of Chicago Press ''Chicago Manual of Style'' 2010]].</ref> in the United States, provide standards for a wide variety of writing and design topics, including sentence spacing.<ref name="Fogarty 2008. p.85">[[#Fog08|Fogarty 2008]]. p.&nbsp;85.</ref> The majority of style guides now prescribe the use of a single space after terminal punctuation in final written works and publications.<ref name="Fogarty2008"/> A few style guides allow double sentence spacing for draft work, and the ''Gregg Reference Manual'' makes room for double and single sentence spacing based on author preferences.<ref>[[#Sab05|Sabin 2005]]. pp.&nbsp;5–6.</ref> Web design guides do not usually provide guidance on this topic, as "HTML refuses to recognize double spaces altogether."<ref name="Lupton 2004. p.165">[[#Lup04|Lupton 2004]]. p.&nbsp;165.</ref> These works themselves follow the current publication standard of single sentence spacing.<ref>[[#Str08|Strunk and White 1999]]. (1st edition published in 1918.); [[#CSE06|Council of Science Editors 2006]]. (1st edition published in 1960.); [[#Ame07|American Medical Association 2007]]. (1st edition published in 1962.)</ref>

The [[European Union]]'s ''Interinstitutional Style Guide'' (2008) indicates that single sentence spacing is to be used in all European Union publications—encompassing [[Languages of the European Union#Official EU languages|23 languages]].<ref>[[#Pub08|Publications Office of the European Union 2008]]. (1st edition published in 1997.) This manual is "obligatory" for all those in the EU who are involved in preparing EU documents and works [http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-000100.htm]. It is intended to encompass 23 languages within the European Union [http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-000600.htm].</ref> For the English language, the [[European Commission]]'s ''English Style Guide'' (2010) states that sentences are always single-spaced.<ref>[[#Eur10|European Commission Directorate-General for Translation]]. p.&nbsp;22. (1st edition published in 1982.) "Note in particular that&nbsp;... stops (. ? ! : ;) are always followed by only a single (not a double) space."</ref> The ''Style Manual: For Authors, Editors and Printers'' (2007), first published in 1966 by the [[List of members of the Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] Government Printing Office of Australia, stipulates that only one space is used after "sentence-closing punctuation" and that "Programs for word processing and desktop publishing offer more sophisticated, variable spacing, so this practice of double spacing is now avoided because it can create distracting gaps on a page."<ref>[[#Joh07|John Wiley & Sons Australia 2007]]. p.&nbsp;153. The [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] is an organization of 54 English-speaking [[List of members of the Commonwealth of Nations|states]] worldwide.</ref>

National languages not covered by an authoritative [[List of language regulators|language academy]] typically have multiple style guides—only some of which may discuss sentence spacing. This is the case in the United Kingdom. The ''Oxford Style Manual'' (2003) and the [[Modern Humanities Research Association]]'s ''MHRA Style Guide'' (2002) state that only single spacing should be used.<ref>[[#Rit03|Ritter 2003 ''Oxford Style Manual'', 2003]]. p.&nbsp;51. (First published as the ''MHRA Style Book'' in 1971.) "In text, use only a single word space after all sentence punctuation."; [[#Mod02|Modern Humanities Research Association 2002]]. p.&nbsp;6.</ref> In Canada, both the English and French language sections of the ''Canadian Style, A Guide to Writing and Editing'' (1997), prescribe single sentence spacing.<ref>[[#Dun97|Dundurn Press 1997]]. p.&nbsp;113. (1st edition published in 1987.); [[#Pub10|Public Works and Government Services of Canada 2010]]. p.&nbsp;293. "17.07 French Typographical Rules—Punctuation: Adopt the following rules for spacing with punctuation marks. [table] Mark: Period, before: none, after: 1 space."</ref> In the United States, many style guides—such as the ''Chicago Manual of Style'' (2003)—allow only single sentence spacing.<ref>[[#Chi03|University of Chicago Press 2003 ''Chicago Manual of Style'']]. p.&nbsp;61. "2.12 A single character space, not two spaces, should be left after periods at the ends of sentences (both in manuscript and in final, published form)." p.&nbsp;243. "6.11 In typeset matter, one space, not two (in other words, a regular word space), follows any mark of punctuation that ends a sentence, whether a period, a colon, a question mark, an exclamation point, or closing quotation marks." p.&nbsp;243. "6.13 A period marks the end of a declarative or an imperative sentence. It is followed by a single space."</ref> The most important style guide in Italy, ''Il Nuovo Manuale di Stile'' (2009),<ref>[[Sentence spacing#Les09|Lesina 2009]]. (1st edition published in 1986.) "Prefazione: Il manuala intende fornire una serie di indicazioni utili per la stesura di testi di carattere non inventive, quali per esempio manuali, saggi, monografie, relazioni professionali, tesi di laurea, articoli per riviste, ecc."

(Trans."Make sure that between two sentences separated by a period a single space is used before the second sentence, instead of the double spacing used in the United States&nbsp;... Contrary to other languages, no space is to be added before punctuation marks.")</ref>

====Language guides====
Some languages, such as [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], have academies that set language rules. Their publications typically address [[orthography]] and grammar as opposed to matters of typography. Style guides are less relevant for such [[Standard language|languages]], as their academies set [[Linguistic prescription|prescriptive rules]]. For example, the [[Académie française]] publishes the ''[[Dictionnaire de l'Académie française]]'' for French speakers worldwide.<ref>[[#Dic92|Académie française 1992]]. French is spoken in 57&nbsp;countries and territories throughout the world, including Europe, North America, and [[Francophone Africa]]. [http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/francophonie/francophonie.htm Qu'est-ce que la Francophonie?]</ref> The 1992 edition does not provide guidance on sentence spacing, but is single-sentence-spaced throughout—consistent with historical French spacing. The Spanish language is similar. The most important body within the [[Association of Spanish Language Academies]], the [[Real Academia Española]], publishes the ''[[Diccionario de la lengua española de la Real Academia Española|Diccionario de la Lengua Española]]'', which is viewed as prescriptive for the Spanish language worldwide.<ref>[[#Rea01|Real Academia Española 2001]]. p.&nbsp;2.</ref> The 2001 edition does not provide sentence spacing guidance, but is itself single sentence spaced. The German language manual ''[[Rat für deutsche Rechtschreibung|Empfehlungen des Rats für Deutsche Rechtschreibung]]'' ("Recommendations of the Council for German Orthography") (2006) does not address sentence spacing.<ref>[[#Cou10|Council for German Orthography 2010]].</ref> The manual itself uses one space after terminal punctuation. Additionally, the ''[[Duden]]'', the German language dictionary most commonly used in Germany,<ref>[[#Bib10|Bibliographisches Institut AG 2010]].</ref> indicates that double sentence spacing is an error.<ref>[[#BiA10|Bibliographisches Institut AG 2010]]. The Duden was the primary orthography and language guide in Germany until the [[German orthography reform of 1996]] created a multinational council for German [[orthography]] for German-speaking countries—composed of experts from Germany, [[Austria]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Switzerland]]. The current version of the Duden reflects the most recent opinions of this council.</ref>

===Grammar guides===
A few reference grammars address sentence spacing, as increased spacing between words is punctuation in itself.<ref>[[#Bri04|Bringhurst 2004]]. p.&nbsp;30. Bringhurst implies that additional spacing after terminal punctuation is redundant when combined with a period, question mark, or exclamation point. Other sources indicate that the function of terminal punctuation is to mark the end of a sentence and additional measures to perform the same measures are unnecessary.</ref> Most do not. Grammar guides typically cover [[terminal punctuation]] and the proper construction of sentences—but not the spacing between sentences.<ref>[[#Bau05|Baugh 2005]]. p.&nbsp;200; [[#Cut09|Cutts 2009]]. p.&nbsp;79; [[#Gar09|Garner 2009]]. p.&nbsp;935; [[#Les05|Lester 2005]]; [[#Lob09|Loberger 2009]]. p.&nbsp;158; [[#Ste05|Stevenson 2005]]. p.&nbsp;123; [[#Str09|Straus 2009]]. p.&nbsp;52; [[#Str04|Strumpf]]. p.&nbsp;408; [[#Tag09|Taggart 2009]].</ref> Moreover, many modern grammar guides are designed for quick reference<ref>[[#Bau05|Baugh 2005]]. p.&nbsp;200; [[#Hop04|Hopper 2004]]; [[#Ste05|Stevenson 2005]]. p.&nbsp;123.</ref> and refer users to comprehensive [[style guide]]s for additional matters of writing style.<ref>[[#Fog08|Fogarty 2008]]. p.&nbsp;85; [[#Lob09|Loberger 2009]]. p.&nbsp;158.</ref> For example, the ''Pocket Idiot's Guide to Grammar and Punctuation'' (2005) points users to style guides such as the ''[[The MLA Style Manual|MLA Style Manual]]'' for consistency in formatting work and for all other "editorial concerns".<ref>[[#Ste05|Stevenson 2005]]. pp.&nbsp;xvi,&nbsp;123.</ref> The ''Grammar Bible'' (2004) states that "The modern system of English punctuation is by no means simple. A book that covers all the bases would need to be of considerable breadth and weight and anyone interested in such a resource is advised to consult the ''Chicago Manual of Style''."<ref>[[#Str04|Strumpf 2004]]. p.&nbsp;408.</ref>

==Digital age==
{{Main article|Sentence spacing in digital media}}

In the computer era, spacing between sentences is handled in several different ways by various software packages. Some systems accept whatever the user types, while others attempt to alter the spacing, or use the user input as a method of detecting sentences. Computer-based word processors, and [[typesetting]] [[software]] such as [[troff]] and [[TeX]], allow users to arrange text in a manner previously only available to professional typesetters.<ref>[[#Fel03|Felici 2003]]. 80; [[#Fog08|Fogarty 2008]]. p.&nbsp;85; [[#Fog09|Fogarty 2009]]. p.&nbsp;78; [[#Fon07|Fondiller and Nerone 2007]]. 93; [[#Gar06|Garner, Newman and Jackson 2006]]. 83; [[#MLA10|Modern Language Association 2009]] 77; [[#Str09|Straus 2009]]. p.&nbsp;52.</ref>

The text editing environment in [[Emacs]] uses a double space following a period to identify the end of sentences unambiguously; the double space convention prevents confusion with periods within sentences that signify abbreviations. How Emacs recognizes the end of a sentence is controlled by the settings ''sentence-end-double-space'' and ''sentence-end''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stallman|first=Richard|title=The GNU Emacs Manual|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Sentences.html#Sentences|publisher=Free Software Foundation|accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> The [[vi]] editor also follows this convention; thus, it is relatively easy to manipulate (jump over, copy, delete) whole sentences in both [[emacs]] and [[vi]].

The Unix typesetter program [[troff]] uses two spaces to mark the end of a sentence.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ossana|first=Joseph|title=Nroff/Troff User's Manual|url=http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/doctools/troff.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> This allows the typesetter to distinguish sentence endings from abbreviations and to typeset them differently. Early versions of troff,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ossanna|first1=Joseph F.|title=NROFF/TROFF Users's Manual|date=11 October 1976|publisher=Bell Laboratories|location=Murray Hill, New Jersey|page=12|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/Fdownload?doi=10.1.1.47.8354&rep=rep1&type=ps&ei=qey_VcezCobm-QGnxobYDQ&usg=AFQjCNE6hbCT7_kMVS6ZWQ09Lb9aHW7FAA&sig2=FBNff-pNgVG_uNTM2funOA&bvm=bv.99261572,d.cWw|accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref> which only typeset in fixed width fonts, would automatically add a second space between sentences, which were detected based on the combination of terminal punctuation and a line feed.

Microsoft Word does not treat sentences differently by default, but the grammar checking can be set to prefer a specific number of spaces between sentences.

On some modern touch-screen platforms, including Android and iOS, typing two spaces in a row is automatically interpreted to mean the end of a sentence, and a period is automatically inserted. However, only one space is retained.

Multiple spaces are eliminated by default in most World Wide Web content, regardless of whether they are associated with sentences or not. There are options for preserving spacing, such as the CSS white-space property, and the &lt;pre&gt; tag. Twitter retains extra spaces in user input on their website. HTML also includes several other space entities which are not collapsed, such as an em space, an en space, and a non-breaking space. Some unicode space characters are also not collapsed on the web.

==Controversy==
James Felici, author of the ''Complete Manual of Typography'', says that the topic of sentence spacing is "the debate that refuses to die&nbsp;... In all my years of writing about type, it's still the question I hear most often, and a search of the web will find threads galore on the subject".<ref name="Felici 2009" /> This subject is still widely debated today.

Many people are opposed to single sentence spacing for various reasons. Some state that the habit of double spacing is too deeply ingrained to change.<ref name="Williams 2003. p.13">[[#Wil03|Williams 2003]]. p.&nbsp;13.</ref> Others claim that additional space between sentences improves the aesthetics or readability of text.<ref>[[#Will95|Williams 95]]. p.&nbsp;1; [[#Sab05|Sabin 2005]]. pp.&nbsp;5–6.</ref> Proponents of double sentence spacing also state that some publishers may still require double-spaced manuscript submissions from authors. A key example noted is the screenwriting industry's monospaced standard for screenplay manuscripts, [[Courier (typeface)|Courier]], 12-point font,<ref>[[#Tro98|Trotter 1998]]. p.&nbsp;112. Trottier refers to Courier as the industry "standard".</ref> although some works on screenwriting indicate that Courier is merely preferred – proportional fonts may be used.<ref>[[#Rus03|Russin and Downs 2003]]. p.&nbsp;17. The authors state that "Courier 12-point is preferred, although New York, Bookman, and Times will do". [[#AlM01|Allen 2001]]Moira Anderson Allen suggests that publishers are more interested in readable fonts as opposed to maintaining a fixed-width font standard.</ref> Some reliable sources state simply that writers should follow their particular style guide, but proponents of double spacing caution that publishers' guidance takes precedence, including those that ask for double sentence spaced manuscripts.<ref>[[#Lob09|Loberger 2009]]. p.&nbsp;158; [[#Ste05|Stevenson 2005]]. p.&nbsp;123; [[#Sam09|Sambuchino 2009]]. p.&nbsp;10.</ref>

One of the most popular arguments against wider sentence spacing is that it was created for monospaced fonts of the typewriter, and is no longer needed with modern proportional fonts.<ref>
 [[#Bri04|Bringhurst 2004]]. p.&nbsp;28;
 [[#Fel03|Felici 2003]]. p.&nbsp;80;
 [[#Fog08|Fogarty 2008]]. p.&nbsp;85;
 [[#Jur09|Jury 2009]]. p.&nbsp;56;
 [[#Shu89|Shushan and Wright 1989]]. p.&nbsp;34;
 [[#Smi09|Smith 2009]];
 [[#Str09|Straus 2009]]. p.&nbsp;52;
 [[#Str10|Strizver 2010]];
 [[#Wal04|Walsh 2004]]. p.&nbsp;3;
 [[#Wil03|Williams 2003]]. p.&nbsp;13.
</ref>
However, proportional fonts existed together with wide sentence spacing for centuries before the typewriter, and remained for decades after its invention. When the typewriter was first introduced, typists were most commonly taught to use three spaces between sentences.<ref name="Wid14"/> This gradually shifted to two spaces, while the print industry remained unchanged in its wide em-spaced sentences. Some sources now state it is acceptable for monospaced fonts to be single spaced today,<ref>[[#Sab05|Sabin 2005]], p.&nbsp;5</ref> although other references continue to specify double spacing for monospaced fonts.<ref>[[#Gar06|Garner, Newman, and Jackson 2006]]. "Continue the custom [of double spacing] only if you use a typewriter or the Courier font."</ref> The double space typewriter convention has been taught in schools in typing classes, and that remains the practice in many cases.<ref name="Strizver 2010" /> Some voice concerns that students will later be forced to relearn how to type.<ref>[[#Llo09|Lloyd and Hallahan 2009]].</ref>

Most style guides indicate that single sentence spacing is proper for final or published work today,<ref name="Fogarty2008"/> and most publishers require manuscripts to be submitted as they will appear in publication—single sentence spaced.<ref>[[#Chi10|University of Chicago Press 2010]]. p.&nbsp;60; [[#Lut05|Lutz 2005]]. p.&nbsp;200; [[#MLA10|Modern Language Association 2009]]. pp.&nbsp;77–78.</ref> Writing sources typically recommend that prospective authors remove extra spaces before submitting manuscripts,<ref>[[#Mod02|Modern Humanities Research Association 2002]]. p.&nbsp;6; [[#Sab05|Sabin 2005]]. p.&nbsp;5; [[#Fel03|Felici 2003]]. p.&nbsp;81; Fogarty also stated in ''Grammar Girl's Quick and Dirty Tips for Better Writing'' that numerous page designers have contacted her, stating that the presence of two spaces between sentences requires them to edit the pages to remove the extra spaces [[#Fog08|Fogarty 2008]]. p.&nbsp;85.</ref> although other sources state that publishers will use software to remove the spaces before final publication.<ref>[[#Chi10|University of Chicago Press 2010]]. p.&nbsp;83; The 16th edition of the ''Chicago Manual of Style'' instructs editors to remove extra spaces between sentences when preparing a manuscript for publication; also [[#Wei09|Weiderkehr 2009]].</ref>

==Effects on readability and legibility==
{{Main article|Sentence spacing studies}}

Claims abound regarding the [[Typography#Readability and legibility|legibility]] and [[readability]] of the single and double sentence spacing methods—by proponents on both sides. Supporters of single spacing assert that familiarity with the current standard in books, magazines, and the Web enhances readability, that double spacing looks strange in text using proportional fonts, and that the "[[river (typography)|rivers]]" and "holes" caused by double spacing impair readability.<ref>[[#Wil03|Williams 2003]]. 13; [[#Smi09|Smith 2009]].</ref> Proponents of double sentence spacing state that the extra space between sentences enhances readability by providing clearer breaks between sentences and making text appear more legible,<ref>[[#Jur04|Jury 2004]]. 92; [[#Wil95|Williams 1995]].</ref> particularly noting the very small visual difference between a dot and a comma.

However, typographic opinions are typically anecdotal with no basis in evidence.<ref>[[#Whe95|Wheildon 1995]]. p.&nbsp;13.</ref> "Opinions are not always safe guides to legibility of print",<ref>[[#Tin63|Tinker 1963]]. p.&nbsp;50.</ref> and when direct studies are conducted, anecdotal opinions—even those of experts—can turn out to be false.<ref>[[#Tin63|Tinker 1963]]. pp.&nbsp;88, 108, 127, 128, 153; [[#Whe95|Wheildon 1995]]. pp.&nbsp;8,&nbsp;35.</ref> Text that seems legible (visually pleasing at first glance) may be shown to actually impair reading effectiveness when subjected to scientific study.<ref>[[#Tin63|Tinker 1963]]. pp.&nbsp;50, 108, 128. A useful example is the [[Helvetica]] font, an ubiquitous font that is considered to be visually pleasing in the construction and viewing of its characters, but has been found to impair reading effectiveness ([[readability]]). See [[#Squ06|Squire 2006]]. p.&nbsp;36.</ref>

===Studies===
Direct studies on sentence spacing include those by Loh, Branch, Shewanown, and Ali (2002); Clinton, Branch, Holschuh, and Shewanown (2003); and Ni, Branch, and Chen (2004), with results favoring neither single, double, nor triple spacing.<ref>[[#Leo09|Leonard, et al. 2009]].</ref> The 2002 study tested participants' reading speed for single and double sentence spaced passages of on-screen text. The authors stated that "the 'double space group' consistently took longer time to finish than the 'single space' group" but concluded that "there was not enough evidence to suggest that a significant difference exists."<ref>[[#Loh02|Loh et al., 2002]]. p.&nbsp;4.</ref> The 2003 and 2004 studies analyzed on-screen single, double, and triple spacing. In both cases, the authors stated that there was insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion.<ref>[[#Cli03|Clinton 2003.]] The study did not find "statistically significant differences between reading time of single and double space[d] passages".</ref> Ni, Branch, Chen, and Clinton conducted a similar study in 2009 using identical spacing variables. The authors concluded that the "results provided insufficient evidence that time and comprehension differ significantly among different conditions of spacing between sentences".<ref>[[#Bra09|Ni et al. 2009]]. pp.&nbsp;383, 387, 390. This study "explored the effects of spacing after the period on on-screen reading tasks through two dependent variables, reading time and reading comprehension".</ref>
