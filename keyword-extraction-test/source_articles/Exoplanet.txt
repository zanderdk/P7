The discovery of exoplanets has intensified interest in the search for [[extraterrestrial life]]. There is special interest in planets that orbit in a star's [[habitable zone]], where it is possible for liquid water, a prerequisite for [[life]] on Earth, to exist on the surface. The study of [[planetary habitability]] also considers a wide range of other factors in determining the suitability of a planet for hosting life.<ref name="NYT-20150106-DB">{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=As Ranks of Goldilocks Planets Grow, Astronomers Consider What's Next |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/science/space/as-ranks-of-goldilocks-planets-grow-astronomers-consider-whats-next.html |date=6 January 2015 |work=[[New York Times]]}}</ref>

Besides exoplanets, there are also [[rogue planet]]s, which do not orbit any star and which tend to be considered separately, especially if they are [[gas giant]]s, in which case they are often counted, like [[WISE 0855-0714]], as [[sub-brown dwarf]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=C. |last1=Beichman|first2=Christopher R. |last2=Gelino|first3=J.

== Nomenclature ==
{{Main article|Exoplanet naming convention}}
The exoplanet naming convention is an extension of the system used for naming multiple-star systems as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU). For exoplanets orbiting a single star, the name is normally formed by taking the name of its parent star and adding a lower case letter. The first planet discovered in a system is given the designation "b" (the parent star is considered to be "a") and later planets are given subsequent letters. If several planets in the same system are discovered at the same time, the closest one to the star gets the next letter, followed by the other planets in order of orbital size. A provisional IAU-sanctioned standard exists to accommodate the naming of [[circumbinary planet]]s. A limited number of exoplanets have IAU-sanctioned proper names. Other naming systems exist.

== History of detection ==
For centuries philosophers and scientists suspected that extrasolar planets existed, but there was no way of detecting them or of knowing their frequency or how similar they might be to the planets of the [[Solar System]]. Various detection claims made in the nineteenth century were rejected by astronomers. The first confirmed detection came in 1992, with the discovery of several terrestrial-mass planets orbiting the [[pulsar]] [[PSR B1257+12]].<ref name="Wolszczan" /> The first confirmation of an exoplanet orbiting a [[main-sequence]] star was made in 1995, when a giant planet was found in a four-day orbit around the nearby star [[51 Pegasi]]. Some exoplanets have been [[Direct imaging|imaged directly]] by telescopes, but the vast majority have been detected through indirect methods such as the [[transit method]] and the [[Doppler spectroscopy|radial-velocity method]].

=== Early speculations ===
{{Rquote |right |This space we declare to be infinite... In it are an infinity of worlds of the same kind as our own.|Giordano Bruno (1584)<ref>{{cite book |title=To Infinity and Beyond: A Cultural History of the Infinite |author=Eli Maor |chapter=Chapter 24: The New Cosmology |date=1987 |isbn=978-1-4612-5396-9 |publisher=Birkhäuser |location=Boston, MA |page=198 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=v0btBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA198&dq=infinity+of+worlds+of+the+same+kind+as+our+own#v=onepage&q=infinity%20of%20worlds%20of%20the%20same%20kind%20as%20our%20own&f=false |access-date=9 July 2016 |others=Originally in ''De l'infinito universo et mondi'' [''On the Infinite Universe and Worlds''] by Giordano Bruno (1584).}}</ref>}}

In the sixteenth century the Italian philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]], an early supporter of the [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] theory that Earth and other planets orbit the Sun ([[heliocentrism]]), put forward the view that the fixed stars are similar to the Sun and are likewise accompanied by planets.

In the eighteenth century the same possibility was mentioned by [[Isaac Newton]] in the "[[General Scholium]]" that concludes his ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''. Making a comparison to the Sun's planets, he wrote "And if the fixed stars are the centers of similar systems, they will all be constructed according to a similar design and subject to the dominion of ''One''."<ref>{{Cite book |last = Newton|first = Isaac|author2 = I.

In 1952, more than 40 years before the first [[hot Jupiter]] was discovered, [[Otto Struve]] wrote that there is no compelling reason why planets could not be much closer to their parent star than is the case in the Solar System, and proposed that [[Doppler spectroscopy]] and the [[transit method]] could detect [[super-Jupiter]]s in short orbits.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://astro.berkeley.edu/~gmarcy/struve.html|title= Proposal for a project of high-precision stellar radial velocity work|last=Struve|first= Otto |journal= The Observatory|volume=72|pages=199–200 |year=1952|bibcode = 1952Obs....72..199S }}</ref>

=== Discredited claims ===
Claims of exoplanet detections have been made since the nineteenth century. Some of the earliest involve the [[binary star]] [[70 Ophiuchi|70&nbsp;Ophiuchi]]. In 1855 Capt. W. S. Jacob at the [[British East India Company|East India Company]]'s [[Madras Observatory]] reported that orbital anomalies made it "highly probable" that there was a "planetary body" in this system.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Jacob, W.

On 6 October 1995, [[Michel Mayor]] and [[Didier Queloz]] of the [[University of Geneva]] announced the first definitive detection of [[51 Pegasi b|an exoplanet]] orbiting a [[main sequence|main-sequence]] star, namely the nearby [[G-type star]] [[51 Pegasi]].<ref name="Mayor">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/378355a0| title = A Jupiter-mass companion to a solar-type star| journal = Nature| volume = 378| issue = 6555| pages = 355–359| year = 1995| last1 = Mayor | first1 = M. | last2 = Queloz | first2 = D. | bibcode = 1995Natur.378..355M}}</ref><ref name=gibn>{{cite journal|last1=Gibney|first1=Elizabeth|title=In search of sister earths|journal=Nature|date=18 December 2013|volume=504|issue=7480|page=361|doi=10.1038/504357a|url=http://www.nature.com/news/365-days-nature-s-10-1.14367|bibcode = 2013Natur.504..357. }}</ref> This discovery, made at the [[Observatoire de Haute-Provence]], ushered in the modern era of exoplanetary discovery. Technological advances, most notably in high-resolution [[spectroscopy]], led to the rapid detection of many new exoplanets: astronomers could detect exoplanets indirectly by measuring their [[gravity|gravitational]] influence on the motion of their host stars. More extrasolar planets were later detected by observing the variation in a star's apparent luminosity as an orbiting planet passed in front of it.

Initially, most known exoplanets were massive planets that orbited very close to their parent stars. Astronomers were surprised by these "[[hot Jupiter]]s", because theories of [[Nebular hypothesis#Formation of planets|planetary formation]] had indicated that giant planets should only form at large distances from stars. But eventually more planets of other sorts were found, and it is now clear that hot Jupiters make up the minority of exoplanets.

The apparent brightness ([[apparent magnitude]]) of a planet depends on how far away the observer is, how reflective the planet is ([[albedo]]), and how much light the planet receives from its star, which depends on how far the planet is from the star and how bright the star is. So, a planet with a low albedo that is close to its star can appear brighter than a planet with high albedo that is far from the star.<ref>[http://phl.upr.edu/library/notes/theapparentbrightnessandsizeofexoplanetsandtheirstars The Apparent Brightness and Size of Exoplanets and their Stars], Abel Mendez, updated 30 June 2012, 12:10 PM</ref>

The darkest known planet in terms of [[geometric albedo]] is [[TrES-2b]], a [[hot Jupiter]] that reflects less than 1% of the light from its star, making it less reflective than coal or black acrylic paint. Hot Jupiters are expected to be quite dark due to sodium and potassium in their atmospheres but it is not known why TrES-2b is so dark—it could be due to an unknown chemical.<ref name=darkest_news>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/12612-alien-planet-darkest-coal-black-kepler.html | title = Coal-Black Alien Planet Is Darkest Ever Seen|publisher=Space.com|accessdate=12 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|arxiv=1108.2297|bibcode = 2011MNRAS.417L..88K |doi = 10.1111/j.1745-3933.2011.01127.x | volume=417|title=Detection of visible light from the darkest world|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: Letters|pages=L88–L92|year = 2011 |last1 = Kipping |first1 = David M. |last2 = Spiegel |first2 = David S. }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/761/1/53|arxiv=1210.4592| title = Photometrically derived masses and radii of the planet and star in the TrES-2 system| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 761| page = 53| year = 2012| last1 = Barclay | first1 = T. | last2 = Huber | first2 = D. | last3 = Rowe | first3 = J.

For [[gas giant]]s, geometric albedo generally decreases with increasing metallicity or atmospheric temperature unless there are clouds to modify this effect. Increased cloud-column depth increases the albedo at optical wavelengths, but decreases it at some infrared wavelengths. Optical albedo increases with age, because older planets have higher cloud-column depths. Optical albedo decreases with increasing mass, because higher-mass giant planets have higher surface gravities, which produces lower cloud-column depths. Also, elliptical orbits can cause major fluctuations in atmospheric composition, which can have a significant effect.<ref name="wfirstreturn">{{cite arXiv|eprint=1412.6097|last1=Burrows|first1=Adam|title=Scientific Return of Coronagraphic Exoplanet Imaging and Spectroscopy Using WFIRST|class=astro-ph.EP|year=2014}}</ref>

There is more thermal emission than reflection at some near-infrared wavelengths for massive and/or young gas giants. So, although optical brightness is fully [[Planetary phase|phase]]-dependent, this is not always the case in the near infrared.<ref name="wfirstreturn" />

Temperatures of gas giants reduce over time and with distance from their star. Lowering the temperature increases optical albedo even without clouds. At a sufficiently low temperature, water clouds form, which further increase optical albedo. At even lower temperatures ammonia clouds form, resulting in the highest albedos at most optical and near-infrared wavelengths.<ref name="wfirstreturn" />

=== Magnetic field ===

In 2014, a magnetic field around [[HD 209458 b]] was inferred from the way hydrogen was evaporating from the planet. It is the first (indirect) detection of a magnetic field on an exoplanet. The magnetic field is estimated to be about one tenth as strong as Jupiter's.<ref>[http://www.space.com/27828-alien-planet-magnetic-field-strength.html Unlocking the Secrets of an Alien World's Magnetic Field], Space.com, by Charles Q.

Earth's magnetic field results from its flowing liquid metallic core, but in super-Earths the mass can produce high pressures with large viscosities and high melting temperatures which could prevent the interiors from separating into different layers and so result in undifferentiated coreless mantles. Magnesium oxide, which is rocky on Earth, can be a liquid metal at the pressures and temperatures found in super-Earths and could generate a magnetic field in the mantles of super-Earths.<ref>[http://www.space.com/18604-super-earth-planets-liquid-metal.html Super-Earths Get Magnetic 'Shield' from Liquid Metal], Charles Q. Choi, SPACE.com, 22 November 2012.</ref>

[[Hot Jupiter]]s have been observed to have a larger radius than expected. This could be caused by the interaction between the [[stellar wind]] and the planet's magnetosphere creating an [[Joule heating|electric current through the planet that heats]] it up causing it to expand. The more magnetically active a star is the greater the stellar wind and the larger the electric current leading to more heating and expansion of the planet. This theory matches the observation that stellar activity is correlated with inflated planetary radii.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/765/2/L25| title = Stellar Magnetic Fields As a Heating Source for Extrasolar Giant Planets| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 765| issue = 2| pages = L25| year = 2013| last1 = Buzasi | first1 = D.|arxiv = 1302.1466 |bibcode = 2013ApJ...765L..25B }}</ref>

=== Plate tectonics ===

In 2007 two independent teams of researchers came to opposing conclusions about the likelihood of [[plate tectonics]] on larger [[super-Earth]]s<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2009.07.015|title=Convection scaling and subduction on Earth and super-Earths|date=2009|last1=Valencia|first1=Diana|last2=O'Connell|first2=Richard J.|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=286|issue=3–4|pages=492–502|bibcode = 2009E&PSL.286..492V }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2011.07.029|title=Plate tectonics on super-Earths: Equally or more likely than on Earth|date=2011|last1=Van Heck|first1=H.J.|last2=Tackley|first2=P.J.|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=310|issue=3–4|pages=252–261|bibcode = 2011E&PSL.310..252V }}</ref> with one team saying that plate tectonics would be episodic or stagnant<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/2007GL030598 |title=Geological consequences of super-sized Earths |date=2007 |last1=O'Neill |first1=C. |last2=Lenardic |first2=A. |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=34 |issue=19|pages=L19204 |bibcode = 2007GeoRL..3419204O }}</ref> and the other team saying that plate tectonics is very likely on super-Earths even if the planet is dry.<ref>{{Cite journal |first1=Diana |last1=Valencia |first2=Richard J. |last2=O'Connell |first3=Dimitar D |last3=Sasselov |date=November 2007 |title=Inevitability of Plate Tectonics on Super-Earths |journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters |volume=670 |issue=1 |pages=L45–L48 |doi=10.1086/524012 |arxiv=0710.0699 |ref=CITEREFValenciaO'ConnellSasselov2007 |bibcode=2007ApJ...670L..45V}}</ref>

If super-Earths have more than 80 times as much water as Earth then they become [[ocean planet]]s with all land completely submerged. However, if there is less water than this limit, then the deep water cycle will move enough water between the oceans and mantle to allow continents to exist.<ref>[http://astrobiology.com/2014/01/super-earths-likely-to-have-both-oceans-and-continents.html Super Earths Likely To Have Both Oceans and Continents], astrobiology.com. 7 January 2014</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/781/1/27| title = Water Cycling Between Ocean and Mantle: Super-Earths Need Not Be Waterworlds| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 781| page = 27| year = 2014| last1 = Cowan | first1 = N.

The rings of the Solar System's gas giants are aligned with their planet's equator. However, for exoplanets that orbit close to their star, tidal forces from the star would lead to the outermost rings of a planet being aligned with the planet's orbital plane around the star. A planet's innermost rings would still be aligned with the planet's equator so that if the planet has a [[axial tilt|tilted rotational axis]], then the different alignments between the inner and outer rings would create a warped ring system.<ref>{{cite journal |arxiv=1104.3863|bibcode = 2011ApJ...734..117S |doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/734/2/117 | volume=734 |issue = 2 |title=Warm Saturns: On the Nature of Rings around Extrasolar Planets That Reside inside the Ice Line |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |page=117|year = 2011 |last1 = Schlichting |first1 = Hilke E. |last2 = Chang |first2 = Philip }}</ref>
