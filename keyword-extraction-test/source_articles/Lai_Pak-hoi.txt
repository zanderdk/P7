==Biography==

The China-America Company, or Hua Mei, was founded by Lai with his former colleague Brodsky and Lai's brother, [[Lai Man-Wai]].<ref name="ECF2" />

Lai, along with his brothers Lai Man-wai and Lai Hoi-shan, founded the first Chinese-owned production company in China, the [[Minxin Film Company]].<ref name="HR" /> The [[British Hong Kong|British colonial government]] rejected their plans to build the studio in Hong Kong, so they were forced to do so in neighboring [[Guangzhou]] in 1924.

In 1925, Lai directed ''Rouge'', the region's first feature-length film.<ref name="ECF3">{{Cite book | last = Zhang | first = Yingjin | last2 = Xiao  | first2 = Zhiwei | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Encyclopedia of Chinese Film | publisher = Taylor & Francis | year = 1998 | location = | pages = 216 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-415-15168-9}}</ref> He also started the China Sound and Silent Movies Company, which released the first [[Cantonese]] [[talkie]], ''Conscience'', in Hong Kong in 1933.  ''Conscience'' was only a partial sound film however, a full sound film, ''An Idiot Disturbs the House'', was released the same year.<ref name="HR" />

Lai left the Hong Kong film industry in 1935, and died later in 1950.<ref name="ECF" />
