'''''Casino Royale''''' (2006) is the 21st film in the [[Eon Productions]] [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' film series]] and the first to star [[Daniel Craig]] as the fictional [[MI6]] agent [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]]. Directed by [[Martin Campbell]] and written by [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade|Neal Purvis & Robert Wade]] and [[Paul Haggis]], the film marks the third screen adaptation of [[Ian Fleming]]'s 1953 [[Casino Royale (novel)|novel of the same name]].  ''Casino Royale'' is set at the beginning of Bond's career as Agent 007, just as he is earning his [[licence to kill (concept)|licence to kill]]. After preventing a terrorist attack at [[Miami International Airport]], Bond falls in love with [[Vesper Lynd]], the treasury employee assigned to provide the money he needs to bankrupt a terrorist financier, [[Le Chiffre]], by beating him in a high-stakes [[poker]] game. The [[story arc]] continues in the following ''Bond'' film ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'' (2008). ''[[Skyfall]]'' (2012) and ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' (2015) also feature explicit references to characters and events in this film.

''Casino Royale'' [[Reboot (fiction)|reboots]] the series, establishing a new [[timeline]] and narrative framework not meant to [[prequel|precede]] or [[sequel|succeed]] any previous ''Bond'' film,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/jamesbond/8255072/Sam-Mendes-may-have-problems-directing-new-Bond-movie.html | location=London | newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | first=Tim | last=Robey | title=Sam Mendes may have problems directing new James Bond movie | date=12 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=IGN: Interview: Campbell on Casino Royale|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/659/659741p1.html|work=IGN.com|publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc|date=19 October 2005|accessdate=22 March 2007}}</ref> which allows the film to show a less experienced and more vulnerable Bond.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/3121-movie-review-james-bond-proves-worthy-double-0-status.html |title=New James Bond Proves Worthy of Double-0 Status |accessdate=16 June 2007 |work=[[Space.com]] |date=21 October 2006}}</ref> Additionally, the character [[Miss Moneypenny]] is, for the first time in the series, completely absent.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a328965/naomie-harris-confirmed-as-james-bond-23s-miss-moneypenny.html | title=Naomie Harris confirmed as 'James Bond 23's Miss Moneypenny | publisher=Digital Spy | date=8 July 2011 | accessdate=31 January 2014 | author=Reynolds, Simon}}</ref> Casting the film involved a widespread search for a new actor to portray James Bond, and significant controversy surrounded Craig when he was selected to succeed [[Pierce Brosnan]] in October 2005. Location filming took place in the [[Czech Republic]], the Bahamas, Italy and the United Kingdom with interior sets built at [[Barrandov Studios]] and [[Pinewood Studios]]. Although part of the storyline is set in [[Montenegro]], no filming took place there. ''Casino Royale'' was produced by Eon Productions for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[Columbia Pictures]], making it the first Eon-produced ''Bond'' film to be [[International co-production|co-produced]] by the latter studio.

''Casino Royale'' premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on 14 November 2006. It received positive critical response, with reviewers highlighting Craig's reinvention of the character and the film's departure from the tropes of previous Bond films. It earned almost ${{Format price|600000000}} worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing ''James Bond'' film until the release of ''[[Skyfall]]'' in 2012.

==Plot==
In [[Prague]], [[James Bond]] kills traitorous [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] station chief [[List of henchmen of James Bond villains#Casino Royale|Dryden]] and his terrorist contact, thus earning his [[license to kill (concept)|license to kill]] and becoming a [[00 agent]].

In Uganda, the mysterious [[Mr. White (James Bond)|Mr. White]] introduces warlord [[List of henchmen of James Bond villains#Casino Royale|Steven Obanno]] to [[Le Chiffre]], a French financier of terrorism. Obanno entrusts Le Chiffre with a large sum of money, which Le Chiffre uses to [[Short (finance)|short-sell]] stock in the aerospace company Skyfleet, thus betting Obanno's money on the company's failure.

In [[Madagascar]], Bond pursues bomb maker [[List of henchmen of James Bond villains#Casino Royale|Mollaka]] to an African embassy. Bond kills Mollaka and blows up the building.  In London, MI6 chief [[M (James Bond)|M]] admonishes Bond for his rashness, and advises him to rethink his future as an agent.

Clues from Mollaka point to corrupt Greek official [[Alex Dimitrios]]. Bond finds Dimitrios in the [[Bahamas]] and pursues him to [[Miami]]. Bond kills Dimitrios and follows his henchman to the airport. He thwarts the destruction of [[Skyfleet S570|Skyfleet's airliner]], costing Le Chiffre his investment. To recoup the money, Le Chiffre sets up a high-stakes [[Texas hold 'em]] tournament at the Casino Royale in [[Montenegro]]. MI6 enters Bond in the tournament, believing a defeat will force Le Chiffre to aid the [[British government]] in exchange for protection from his creditors. On the train to Montenegro, Bond meets [[Vesper Lynd]], a [[HM Treasury|British Treasury]] agent there to protect the government's $10&nbsp;million [[buying in (poker)|buy-in]].

In Montenegro, Bond and Vesper meet their MI6 contact, [[René Mathis]]. When the tournament begins, Bond appears to have the upper hand. In Le Chiffre's suite, Obanno ambushes him, furious over the loss of his money. Bond engages Obanno, and in an ensuing struggle, kills him and his henchmen. Vesper is traumatized, but Bond comforts her. When the tournament resumes, Bond loses his initial stake, and Vesper refuses to fund further playing. Frustrated, Bond is about to assassinate Le Chiffre when he meets [[Felix Leiter]], a fellow player and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent. Leiter stakes Bond in exchange for custody of Le Chiffre.

Le Chiffre's girlfriend [[List of henchmen of James Bond villains#Casino Royale|Valenka]] poisons Bond's [[Martini (cocktail)|martini]]. Bond throws up the poison and escapes to his [[Aston Martin]], where he injects an antidote. MI6 instructs him to use the [[defibrillator]], but he finds that one of the wires is disconnected. Vesper saves Bond by connecting the wires and pushing the button. Bond returns to the game, and wins with a [[straight flush]].

Le Chiffre captures Vesper and Bond, and reveals that Mathis is working for him. Le Chiffre tortures Bond for the password to the account containing his money, but Bond refuses to give in. As Le Chiffre prepares to castrate Bond, Mr. White bursts in and kills him. Bond awakens in a hospital on [[Lake Como]] and Mathis is taken in by MI6. Bond and Vesper fall in love, and he decides to resign from MI6 to be with her.

Bond and Vesper travel to [[Venice]]. M calls Bond and tells him the money was never deposited, and Bond realizes Vesper has stolen the money. He pursues her and her clients into a building under renovation. In the ensuing struggle, the building is damaged and begins sinking into the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]]. Bond kills Vesper's accomplices and tries to rescue her, but she drowns herself as the building sinks. Mr. White, watching nearby, walks away with the money.

Bond rejoins MI6, and copes with Vesper's death by renouncing her as a traitor. M informs him [[Quantum of Solace|the same organisation]] behind Le Chiffre had kidnapped Vesper's lover, and threatened to kill him unless she became a [[double agent]]. During the torture sessions with Le Chiffre, Vesper had made a deal: the money in exchange for Bond's life. Bond discovers a text message left for him by Vesper with Mr. White's name and phone number.

At his estate in Lake Como, Mr. White receives a phone call, and is shot in the leg when he answers. Bond strolls into his path holding a machine gun, and introduces himself: "The name's Bond... James Bond."

''Casino Royale'' includes a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] by British entrepreneur [[Richard Branson]] (seen being frisked at [[Miami International Airport]]).

==Production==
''Casino Royale'' had been previously produced as a [[Casino Royale (Climax!)|1954 television episode]] and a [[Casino Royale (1967 film)|1967 satirical film]].  [[Eon Productions]] gained the rights to ''Casino Royale'' in 1999 after [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] exchanged them for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s rights to ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Sony Pictures, in an accord with MGM, drops its plan to produce new James Bond movies |work=The New York Times |date=30 March 1999 |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30814FC35540C738FDDAA0894D1494D81&n=Top%2fNews%2fBusiness%2fSmall%20Business%2fMarketing%20and%20Advertising |accessdate=20 June 2007 | first=James | last=Sterngold}}</ref> In March 2004, [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade]] began writing a screenplay for Pierce Brosnan as Bond, aiming to bring back the flavour of [[Ian Fleming]]'s original ''Bond'' novels.<ref>{{cite web|title=Purvis & Wade Talk Bond & Jinx |work=[[MI6.co.uk|MI6-HQ.com]] |date=9 March 2004 |url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/event_purvis_wade_talk.php3?t=bond21&s=bond21 |accessdate=10 March 2007}}</ref> [[Paul Haggis]]' main contribution was to rewrite the climax of the film. He explained, "the draft that was there was very faithful to the book and there was a confession, so in the original draft the character confessed and killed herself. She then sent Bond to chase after the villains; Bond chased the villains into the house. I don't know why but I thought that Vesper had to be in the sinking house and Bond has to want to kill her and then try and save her."<ref>{{Cite news|first=Mark |last=Lawson |title=Paul Haggis |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=4 December 2007 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2007/dec/04/guardianinterviewsatbfisouthbank1 |accessdate=7 December 2007 }}</ref>

Director [[Quentin Tarantino]] expressed interest in directing an adaptation of ''Casino Royale'',<ref>{{Cite news|title=Kill Bill director aims for Bond |work=BBC News |date=16 May 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3718975.stm |accessdate=5 March 2007}}</ref> but Eon were not interested. He claims to have worked behind the scenes with the Fleming family, and believed this was the reason why filmmakers finally went ahead with ''Casino Royale''.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Chris |last=Heath |title=Quentin Tarantino Interview |work=[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]] |date=June 2007}}</ref> Tarantino also said, he would have set it in the 1960s and would have only made it with [[Pierce Brosnan]] as Bond. In February 2005, [[Martin Campbell]] was announced as the film's director.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eon Productions |title=James Bond 21 Is Casino Royale |work=[[MI6.co.uk|MI6-HQ.com]] |date=3 February 2005 |url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/bond_21_announced.php3 |accessdate=10 March 2007}}</ref> Later in 2005, [[Sony]] led a consortium that purchased MGM, allowing Sony to gain distribution rights starting with the film.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Consortium Led by Sony Corporation of America, Providence Equity Partners, Texas Pacific Group, Comcast Corporation, and DLJ Merchant Banking Partners Enters into Definitive Agreement to Acquire Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer |publisher=Sony Corporation |date=23 September 2004 |url=http://www.sony.com/SCA/press/040924.shtml |accessdate=29 April 2007}}</ref>

Eon believed that they had relied too heavily on [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects in the more recent films, particularly ''[[Die Another Day]]'', and were keen to accomplish the stunts in ''Casino Royale'' "the old fashioned way".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Alberge |first=Dayla |title=Fake stunts banished as new Bond keeps it real |work=The Times |location=UK |date=14 March 2006 |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/film/article2433165.ece |accessdate=21 November 2006 }}</ref> In keeping with this drive for more realism, screenwriters Purvis, Wade and Haggis wanted the script to follow as closely as possible to the original 1953 novel, keeping Fleming's darker storyline and characterisation of Bond.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Jon |last=Silberg |title=High Stakes for 007 |work=[[American Cinematographer]] |date = December 2006|url=http://www.ascmag.com/magazine_dynamic/December2006/CasinoRoyale/page1.php |accessdate=17 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070402131840/http://www.ascmag.com/magazine_dynamic/December2006/CasinoRoyale/page1.php |archivedate=2 April 2007}}</ref>

===Casting===
[[Pierce Brosnan]] had signed a deal for four films when he was cast in the role of James Bond. This was fulfilled with the production of ''Die Another Day'' in 2002. At this stage, Brosnan was approaching his 50th birthday. Brosnan kept in mind fans and critics were not happy with [[Roger Moore]] playing Bond until he was 58 and speculation began the producers were seeking to replace Brosnan with a younger actor.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Is Brosnan too old to be 007? |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-207653/Is-Brosnan-old-007.html |work=Daily Mail |location=UK |date=9 February 2004 |accessdate=5 August 2008 }}</ref> Brosnan officially announced he was stepping down in February 2004. At one point, producer [[Michael G.

In May 2005, English actor [[Daniel Craig]] stated MGM and producers [[Michael G. Wilson]] and [[Barbara Broccoli]] had assured him he would get the role of Bond, and [[Matthew Vaughn]] told reporters MGM offered him the opportunity to direct the new film, but Eon Productions at that point had not approached either of them.<ref>{{cite web|title=Craig, Vaughn on Bond |url=http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/609/609721p1.html |work=[[IGN]] |date=3 May 2005 |accessdate=10 August 2006}}</ref> A year beforehand, Craig rejected the idea of starring, as he felt the series had descended into [[formula fiction|formula]]; only when he read the script did he become interested. Craig read all of Fleming's novels to prepare for the part, and cited [[Mossad]] and [[British Secret Service]] agents who served as advisors on the set of ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'' as inspiring because, "Bond has just come out of the service and he's a killer. [...] You can see it in their eyes, you know immediately: oh, hello, he's a killer. There's a look. These guys walk into a room and very subtly they check the perimeters for an exit.

On 14 October 2005 Eon Productions, Sony Pictures Entertainment and MGM announced at a press conference in London that Craig would be the sixth actor to portray James Bond.

The next important casting was that of the lead [[Bond girl]], Vesper Lynd.

Principal photography for ''Casino Royale'' commenced on 3 January 2006 and concluded on 20 July 2006. The film was primarily shot at [[Barrandov Studios]] in Prague, with additional location shooting in the [[Bahamas]], Italy and the United Kingdom.

Michael G. Wilson had stated ''Casino Royale'' would either be filmed or take place in Prague and South Africa. However, Eon Productions encountered problems in securing film locations in South Africa.<ref>{{Cite news|first=John |last=Cox |title=Eon facing South African detour |work=CommanderBond.net |date=8 August 2005 |url=http://commanderbond.net/2877/eon-facing-south-african-detour.html |accessdate=21 November 2006}}</ref> After no other locations became available, the producers had to reconsider their options. In September 2005, Martin Campbell and [[cinematographer|director of photography]] [[Phil Meheux]] were scouting [[Atlantis Paradise Island|Paradise Island]] in the Bahamas as a possible location for the film.<ref>{{Cite news|first=John |last=Cox |title=Bond bound for Bahamas |date=13 September 2005 |work=CommanderBond.net |url=http://commanderbond.net/2922/bond-bound-for-bahamas.html |accessdate=21 November 2006}}</ref> On 6 October 2005, Martin Campbell confirmed ''Casino Royale'' would film in the Bahamas and "maybe Italy". In addition to the extensive location filming, studio work including choreography and stunt co-ordination practice was performed at the Barrandov Studios in Prague, and at Pinewood Studios, where the film used several stages, the paddock tank and the [[007 Stage]]. Further shooting in the UK was scheduled for [[Dunsfold Aerodrome]] in Surrey, the cricket pavilion at [[Eton College]] (although that particular scene was cut from the completed movie) and the Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground in [[Bedfordshire]].<ref name="Location2"/>

After Prague, the production moved to the Bahamas. Several locations around [[New Providence]] were used for filming during February and March, particularly on Paradise Island. Footage set in [[Mbale]], Uganda, was filmed at [[Black Park]], a Country Park in [[Buckinghamshire]], on 4 July 2006. Additional scenes took place at Albany House, an estate owned by golfers [[Ernie Els]] and [[Tiger Woods]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=James Bond takes over Ernie and Tiger's pad |publisher=Ernie Els Official Website |date=12 June 2006 |url=http://www.ernieels.com/search.aspx?i_MediaEntryID=506 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618111857/http://www.ernieels.com/search.aspx?i_MediaEntryID=506 |archivedate=18 June 2006 |accessdate=21 November 2006}}</ref> The crew returned to the Czech Republic in April, and continued there, filming in Prague, [[Planá (Tachov District)|Planá]] and [[Loket (Sokolov District)|Loket]], before completing in the town of [[Karlovy Vary]] in May.

A recreation of the [[Body Worlds]] exhibit provided a setting for one scene in the film. Among the Body Worlds plastinates featured in that scene were the ''[http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/media/picture_database/preview.html?id=78 Poker Playing Trio]'' (which plays a key role in one scene) and ''[http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/media/picture_database/preview.html?id=129 Rearing Horse and Rider]''. The exhibition's developer and promoter, German anatomist [[Gunther von Hagens]], also has a cameo appearance in the film,<ref>{{cite web|title=Press Information & Media News |url= http://www.plastinarium.de/en/media/media_news.html |work=Plastinarium |accessdate=9 August 2010}}</ref> although only his trademark hat is actually visible on screen.

===Effects===
In designing the credit sequence for the film, graphic designer [[Daniel Kleinman]] was inspired by the cover of the 1953 British first edition of ''Casino Royale'', which featured Ian Fleming's original design of a playing card bordered by eight red hearts dripping with blood. Kleinman said, "The hearts not only represent cards but the tribulations of Bond's love story. So I took that as inspiration to use playing card graphics in different ways in the titles," like a club representing a puff of gun smoke, and slashed arteries spurting thousands of tiny hearts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Credits design |url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/news/index.php?itemid=4511 |work=[[MI6.co.uk|MI6-HQ.COM]] |date=6 December 2006 |accessdate=3 April 2007}}</ref> In creating the shadow images of the sequence, Kleinman digitised the footage of Craig and the film's stuntmen on the [[Inferno (operating system)|Inferno]] visual effects system, at [[Framestore CFC]] in London; the actors' silhouettes were incorporated into more than 20 digitally animated scenes depicting intricate and innovative card patterns. Kleinman decided not to use the female silhouettes commonly seen throughout the Bond title sequences, considering that the women did not fit with both the film's spirit and the storyline following Bond falling in love.<ref>{{cite web|title=Design / Casino Royale's Title Sequence|publisher=[[Framestore]] |url=http://www.framestore.com/#/Design/CasinoRoyale,TitleSequence |accessdate=29 January 2010}}</ref>

For the rest of the film, [[Chris Corbould]], the special effects and miniature effects supervisor, returned to a more realistic style of film making and significantly reduced digital effects. According to Corbould, "CGI is a great tool and can be very useful, but I will fight to the tooth and nail to do something for real. It's the best way to go".<ref name="Real"/> Three scenes involving primarily physical effects in the film were the chase at a building site in Madagascar, the [[Miami Airport]] chase sequence, and the sinking Venetian house, with sets located on the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]] and in Pinewood Studios.<ref name="Real"/>

First on the schedule were the scenes on the Madagascar building site, shot in the Bahamas on the site of a derelict hotel which Michael G. Wilson had become acquainted with in 1977 during the filming of ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]''.<ref name="Real"/> In the scene, Bond drives a [[Excavator|digger]] toward the building, slamming into the concrete plinth on which Mollaka is running. The stunt team built a model and put forward several ways in which the digger could conceivably take out the concrete, including taking out the pillar underneath. A section of the concrete wall was removed to fit the digger and reinforced with steel.<ref name="Real"/>

The sequence at [[Miami International Airport]] was partly shot at the [[Dunsfold Aerodrome]], in Surrey, which is known from British car show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', with some footage from the Prague and Miami airports.<ref name="Real"/> In filming the scene in which the engine thrust of the moving aircraft blows the police car high into the air, second unit directors Ian Lowe, Terry Madden and Alex Witt used a crane with a strong lead cable attached to the rear bumper of the vehicle to move it up and backwards at the moment of full extension away from the plane.<ref name="Real"/>

The Skyfleet S570 aircraft in the film was an ex-[[British Airways]] 747-200B [[G-BDXJ]] which had its engines removed and was modified for its appearance in the film. The modified aircraft had the outboard engines replaced by external fuel tanks, while the inboard engines were replaced by a mock-up pair of engines on each inboard pylon. The cockpit profile was altered to make the 747 look like a prototype of an advanced airliner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0297.shtml |title=Boeing 747 in Casino Royale}}</ref> The plane used can be seen on the BBC motoring programme ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' on the [[Top Gear Test Track|Test Track]].
[[File:Aston Martin DBS (Casino Royale) front-left-2 National Motor Museum, Beaulieu.jpg|thumbnail|right|Aston Martin DBS driven by Bond in the film]]
The sinking of the Venetian house at the climax of the film featured the largest rig ever built for a Bond film.<ref name="Real"/> For the scene involving Bond following Vesper into the house undergoing renovation supported by inflatable balloons, a tank was constructed at the 007 stage at Pinewood, consisting of a Venetian [[piazza]] and the interior of the three-story dilapidated house. The rig, weighing some 90 tons, incorporated electronics with hydraulic valves which were closely controlled by computer because of the dynamic movement within the system on its two axes. The same computer system also controlled the exterior model which the effects team built to one-third scale to film the building eventually collapsing into the Venetian canal. The model elevator within the rig could be immersed in {{convert|19|ft|m}} of water, and used banks of compressors to strictly regulate movement.<ref name="Real"/>

At the time of filming, [[Aston Martin]] were still in the final phases of designing the [[Aston Martin DBS|DBS]]. The scene involving the car crash was devised using an [[Aston Martin DB9]] that was especially modified to look like Bond's [[Aston Martin DBS V12]] and reinforced to withstand the impact. Due to the low centre of gravity of the vehicle, an 18-inch (450&nbsp;mm) ramp had to be implemented on the road tarmac at [[Millbrook Proving Ground]]s and Adam Kirley, the stunt driver who performed the stunt, had to use an [[air blaster|air cannon]] located behind the driver's seat to propel the car into a roll at the precise moment of impact. At a speed exceeding <span style="white-space:nowrap">70&nbsp;mph&nbsp;(113&nbsp;km/h)</span>, the car rotated seven times while being filmed, and was confirmed by the [[Guinness Book of Records]] on 5 November 2006 as a new [[world record]].<ref name="Real"/>

===Music===

Producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli announced on 26 July 2006  [[Chris Cornell]], then-former lead singer of [[Soundgarden]] and former lead singer of [[Audioslave]], composed and would perform the title song, "[[You Know My Name]]".<ref>{{cite press release|first=Steve |last=Elzer |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/07-26-2006/0004404210&EDATE= |title=Chris Cornell Has Written and Will Perform the Main Title Song for Casino Royale |publisher=Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group |date=26 July 2006 |accessdate=26 July 2006}}</ref> The song's main notes are played throughout the film as a substitute for the [[James Bond theme]], to represent Bond's youth and inexperience.

==Release==
''Casino Royale'' premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]], the [[Odeon West End]] and the [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire]] simultaneously in London on 14 November 2006. It marked the 60th Royal Film Performance and benefited the Cinema & Television Benevolent Fund (CTBF), whose patron, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], was in attendance with the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]]. It is the third James Bond premiere that the Queen attended, following ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' and ''Die Another Day''.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Daniel Craig makes his 007 debut at premiere of Casino Royale |work=Daily Mail |location=UK |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=416461&in_page_id=1773&ico=Homepage&icl=TabModule&icc=picbox&ct=5 |date=18 November 2006 |accessdate=21 November 2006 |first=Nick |last=Goodway}}</ref> Along with the cast and crew, numerous celebrities and 5,000 paying guests were also in attendance with half the proceeds benefiting the CTBF.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Stars out for Bond royal premiere |work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6146090.stm |date=14 November 2006 |accessdate=21 November 2006}}</ref>

Only two days following the premiere, unlicensed copies appeared for sale in London. "The rapid appearance of this film on the streets shows the sophistication and organisation behind film piracy in the UK," said Kieron Sharp, from the [[Federation Against Copyright Theft]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6157066.stm |title=Studio claims 007 box office coup |work=BBC News |date=17 November 2006 |accessdate=28 February 2007}}</ref> Infringing copies of the DVD were selling for less than [[£]]1.57.

In January 2007, ''Casino Royale'' became the first Bond film ever to be shown in mainland Chinese cinemas. The Chinese version was edited before release, with the reference to the [[Cold War]] re-dubbed and new dialogue added during the poker scene explaining the process of [[Texas hold 'em]], as the game is less familiar in China (this addition is reminiscent of dialogue that was added to the [[Casino Royale (Climax!)|1954 American TV adaptation]] to explain the rules of [[Baccarat (card game)|baccarat]], the game featured in the original book). ''Casino Royale'' has earned approximately $11.7&nbsp;million in China since its opening on 30 January on 468 screens,<ref>{{cite web|title=Casino Royale (2006) – International Box Office |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&id=jamesbond21.htm| accessdate=29 March 2007}}</ref> including a record opening weekend collection for a non-Chinese film, with $1.5&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Dave McNary |title=China shows 007 the love |work=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117958463.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&query=casino+royale |date=31 January 2007 |accessdate=20 March 2007}}</ref>

After critics dubbed ''Die Another Day'' "Buy Another Day" because of around 20 [[product placement]] deals, Eon limited their promotions for ''Casino Royale''.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Critics responded with praise to the film, in particular to Craig's performance and credibility. During production, Craig had been subject to debate by the media and the public, as he did not appear to fit Ian Fleming's original portrait of the character as tall, dark and suave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/james-bond/13878/the-ingrid-pitt-column-craig-is-not-bond|title=The Ingrid Pitt column: Craig is not Bond|publisher=''[[Den of Geek]]''|date=30 December 2008|accessdate=10 December 2014}}</ref> ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' compared the quality of Craig's characterisation of Bond to [[Sean Connery]]'s and praised the script as smartly written, noting how the film departed from the series' conventions.

Vicky Allan of the ''[[Sunday Herald]]'' noted Bond himself, and not his love interests, was sexually objectified in this film. A moment where he rises from the sea is reminiscent of [[Ursula Andress]] in ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''; he feels "skewered" by Vesper Lynd's criticism of him; "and though it would be almost unthinkable now have a female character in a mainstream film stripped naked and threatened with genital mutilation, that is exactly what happens to Bond in [the film]." So although the film backed off from past criticism of Bond girls being sex objects, "the once invincible James Bond becomes just another joint at the meat market."<ref>{{Cite news|first=Vicky |last=Allan |title=For your eyes only? |publisher=[[Sunday Herald]] |date=27 October 2008 |url=http://www.sundayherald.com/arts/arts/display.var.2463325.0.0.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103061226/http://www.sundayherald.com/arts/arts/display.var.2463325.0.0.php|archivedate=3 January 2009 |accessdate=27 October 2008}}</ref> This sentiment is shared by the [[University of Leicester]]'s James Chapman, author of ''License to Thrill'', who also notes Craig's Bond is "not yet the polished article"; he felt his incarnation of Bond is close to Fleming's because he is "humourless," but is also different because "Fleming's Bond did not enjoy killing; Craig's Bond seems almost to relish it."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Daniel Craig's Bond "relishes killing," professor claims |publisher=In the news |date=28 October 2008 |url=http://www.inthenews.co.uk/printerfriendly.aspx?itemid=1246720|accessdate=28 October 2008}}</ref> [[Andrew Sarris]] of ''[[The New York Observer]]'' wrote that this particular Bond film is "the very first that I would seriously consider placing on my own yearly 10-best list.

[[Roger Moore]] wrote, "Daniel Craig impressed me so greatly in his debut outing, ''Casino Royale'', by introducing a more gritty, unrefined edge to the character that I thought [[Sean Connery|Sean]] might just have to move over. Craig's interpretation was like nothing we'd seen on screen before; Jimmy Bond was earning his stripes and making mistakes. It was intriguing to see him being castigated by M, just like a naughty schoolboy would be by his headmaster. The script showed him as a vulnerable, troubled, and flawed character. Quite the opposite to my Bond! Craig was, and is, very much the Bond Ian Fleming had described in the books – a ruthless killing machine. It was a Bond that the public wanted." So impressed was Moore that he chose to buy the DVD.<ref>{{Cite news|authorlink=Roger Moore |first=Roger |last=Moore |title=Bye bye to Ian Fleming's James Bond? |work=The Times |location=UK |date=4 October 2008 |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/london_film_festival/article4866756.ece |accessdate=5 October 2008 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rrWp8oPN |archivedate=9 August 2010}}</ref> [[Raymond Benson]], the author of nine ''Bond'' novels, called ''Casino Royale'' "a perfect ''Bond'' film."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemaretro.com/index.php?/archives/20-JAMES-BOND-AUTHOR-RAYMOND-BENSON-REVIEWS-THE-ULTIMATE.html |title=James Bond Author Raymond Benson Reviews the Ultimate – Cinema Retro – Celebrating Films of the 1960s & 1970s |publisher=Cinema Retro |accessdate=12 September 2010}}</ref>

However, the film met with mixed reactions from other critics. Rob Gonsalves of eFilmCritic.com gave the film a positive review, but commented, "When you strip the 007 films down for action and 'realism,' you lose the soul of those old beloved ''Bond'' movies – they might as well be [[Bourne (film series)|Jason Bourne movies]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://efilmcritic.com/review.php?movie=15275&reviewer=416 |title=Casino Royale (2006) |author=Rob Gonsalves |date=20 November 2006 |work=eFilmCritic.com}}</ref> John Beifuss of ''[[The Commercial Appeal]]'' said, "Who wants to see Bond learn a lesson about ego, as if he were [[Greg Brady (Brady Bunch)|Greg Brady]] in his 'Johnny Bravo' phase?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/casino_royale/?critic=columns&sortby=rotten&name_order=asc&$view=#contentReviews |title=Rotten Reviews for Casino Royale-RT.com |work=Rottentomatoes.com |accessdate=25 March 2011}}</ref> [[Anthony Lane]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' criticised the more imperfect and self-aware depiction of the character, saying, "Even James Bond, in other words, wants to be 007."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/11/20/061120crci_cinema?currentPage=2#ixzz0upUk9q3P |title=Of human bondage |work=The New Yorker |author=Anthony Lane |date=20 November 2006 |accessdate=9 August 2010}}</ref>

Though American radio personality [[Michael Medved]] gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as "intriguing, audacious and very original&nbsp;... more believable and less cartoonish, than previous 007 extravaganzas," he commented that the "sometimes sluggish pacing will frustrate some Bond fanatics."<ref>{{Cite news|authorlink=Michael Medved |first=Michael |last=Medved |title=Casino Royale |publisher=[[Townhall.com]]|url=http://townhall.com/TalkRadio/Show.aspx?RadioShowID=4&ContentGuid=43306526-93fb-41b5-80aa-44ec67611670|accessdate=2 September 2010}}</ref> Similarly, a reviewer for ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' praised the film for its darkness and Craig's performance, but felt that "like the novel, it suffers from a lack of sharpness in the plot" and believed that it required additional editing, particularly the finale.<ref>{{Cite news|title=The best Bond since Connery |work=The Sun |location=London |date=20 October 2006 |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/67909/The-best-Bond-since-Connery.html |accessdate=21 November 2006}}</ref> Commentators such as [[Emanuel Levy]] concurred, feeling the ending was too long, and that the film's terrorist villains lacked depth, although he praised Craig and gave the film a B+ overall.<ref>{{cite web|last=Levy |first=Emanuel |title=Casino Royale B+ |publisher=Emanuel Levy |url=http://www.emanuellevy.com/article.php?articleID=3668 |accessdate=21 November 2006}}</ref> Other reviewers responded negatively, including Tim Adams of ''[[The Observer]]'' who felt the film came off uncomfortably in an attempt to make the series grittier.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Adams |first=Tim |title=You might be shaken, but this Bond won't leave you stirred |work=The Observer |location=UK |date=5 November 2006 |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1939830,00.html |accessdate=21 November 2006 }}</ref>
