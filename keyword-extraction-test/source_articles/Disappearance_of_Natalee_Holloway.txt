'''Natalee Ann Holloway''' (born October 21, 1986) was an American teenager who disappeared on May 30, 2005, while on a high school graduation trip to [[Aruba]], a Dutch island in the [[Caribbean]]. Holloway lived in [[Mountain Brook, Alabama]], at the time of her disappearance, and graduated from [[Mountain Brook High School]] on May 24, 2005, shortly before the trip.<ref name="USA Today 2005-06-02" /> Her disappearance caused a [[sensationalism|media sensation]] in the United States<ref name="BBC News 2005-06-25" /> and remains unsolved.

Holloway was scheduled to fly home on May 30, but failed to appear for her flight.<ref name="Court TV 2005-06-08" /> She was last seen by her classmates outside [[Carlos'n Charlie's]], a chain restaurant and nightclub in [[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]],<ref name="CNN 2005-06-09" /> in a car with locals [[Joran van der Sloot]] and brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe. When questioned, the three men said they dropped Holloway off at her hotel and denied knowing what became of her.<ref name="ABC News 2006-02-23" /> Upon further investigation by authorities, Van der Sloot was arrested twice on suspicion of involvement in her disappearance and the Kalpoes were each arrested three times. Due to lack of evidence the three men were released without charge each time.<ref name="CNN 2006-05-31" /><ref name="AP 2007-11-22, 3 re-arrested" />

With the help of hundreds of volunteers, Aruban investigators conducted an extensive search for Holloway. [[Special Agents]] from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]],<ref name="LA Times 2007-06-04" /> fifty [[Netherlands Army|Dutch soldiers]] and three specially equipped [[Royal Netherlands Air Force|Dutch Air Force]] [[F-16]] aircraft participated in the search.<ref name="MSNBC 2005-06-06" /><ref name="AP 2007-11-22, F16" /><ref name="demonstration" /> In addition to the ground search, divers searched the ocean floor for Holloway's body.<ref name="divers" /> It was never found.<ref name="MSNBC 2006-05-23" /><ref name="Alcohol" /><ref name="Rawls 2012-01-12" /> On December 18, 2007, Aruban prosecutors announced that the case would be closed without any charges made against the former suspects.<ref name="Fox News 2007-12-19" /><ref name="USA Today 2007-12-18" /> The Aruban prosecutor's office reopened the case on February 1, 2008, after receiving video footage of Joran van der Sloot, under the influence of [[marijuana]], saying that Holloway died on the morning of May 30, 2005, and that a friend had disposed of her body.<ref name="ABC News 2008-02-03" /> Van der Sloot later denied that what he said was true, and in an interview with [[Greta Van Susteren]] (the contents of which he later retracted) said that he sold Holloway into slavery.<ref name="Fox News 2008-11-24" />

Holloway's parents criticized Aruban police for a lack of rigor in the investigation and questioning of the three men last seen with her. The family also called for a [[boycott]] of Aruba, which gained Alabama Governor [[Bob Riley]]'s support but failed to gain widespread backing.<ref name="USA Today 2005-11-21" /><ref name="NatSupport" /> On January 12, 2012, an Alabama judge declared Holloway legally dead.<ref>{{cite news|title=Natalee Holloway declared dead by judge six years after disappearance|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/12/natalee-holloway-declared-legally-dead|work=The Guardian|accessdate=October 19, 2012|location=London|date=January 12, 2012}}</ref>

== Background ==

[[File:MBHSfront.jpg|thumb|Holloway graduated from [[Mountain Brook High School]] just before the trip to Aruba]]

Natalee Ann Holloway was the first of two children born to David Edward ("Dave") and [[Beth Holloway|Elizabeth Ann Reynolds ("Beth") Holloway]] in [[Clinton, Mississippi]].<ref name="AP 2006-04-25" /> Her parents divorced in 1993, and she and her younger brother Matthew were raised by their mother. In 2000, Elizabeth Holloway married George "Jug" Twitty, a prominent Alabama businessman, and Natalee moved to [[Mountain Brook, Alabama]].<ref name="DHolloway 2001, ch. Everybody's Child / Aruba" /> Natalee Holloway graduated with honors from [[Mountain Brook High School]]. She was a member of the [[National Honor Society]], her school [[dance squad]], and was a participant in other extracurricular activities.<ref name="dependable" /><ref name="reward" /> Holloway was to attend the [[University of Alabama]] on a full scholarship,<ref name="HansenSearch" /> where she planned to pursue a [[Pre-medical|pre-med track]].<ref name="ABC News 2005–06-08" /> At the time of the disappearance, Dave Holloway was an insurance agent for [[State Farm Insurance]] in [[Meridian, Mississippi]], while Beth Twitty was employed by the [[Mountain Brook School System]].<ref name="DHolloway 2006, ch. Everybody's Child / Aruba" /><ref name="State Farm Dave Holloway" /><ref name="CNN 2005-08-18" />

== Disappearance ==

On Thursday, May 26, 2005, Holloway and 124 fellow graduates of Mountain Brook High School, located in a wealthy suburb of [[Birmingham, Alabama]], arrived in Aruba for a five-day, unofficial graduation trip.<ref name="dependable" /><ref name="Court TV 2005-06-07" /> The graduates were accompanied by seven chaperones.<ref name="Vanity" /> According to teacher and chaperone Bob Plummer, the chaperones met with the students each day to ensure nothing was wrong.<ref name="Fox News 2006-02-24" /> Jodi Bearman, who organized the trip, stated, "the chaperones were not supposed to keep up with their every move".<ref name="Vanity" /><ref name="FNCThree" /> [[Police Commissioner]] Gerold Dompig, who headed the investigation from mid-2005 until 2006, described the behavior of the Mountain Brook students, stating there was "wild partying, a lot of drinking, lots of room switching every night. We know the [[Holiday Inn]] told them they weren't welcome next year. Natalee, we know, she drank all day every day. We have statements she started every morning with cocktails—so much drinking that Natalee didn't show up for breakfast two mornings".<ref name="Vanity" /> Two of Holloway's classmates, Liz Cain and Claire Fierman, "agreed that the drinking was kind of excessive".<ref name="dompigalcohol" />

Holloway was last seen by her classmates leaving the Aruban bar and night club [[Carlos'n Charlie's]]<ref name="Court TV 2005-06-10" /> around 1:30&nbsp;a.m. on Monday, May 30.<ref name="FBI Holloway" /> Holloway left with 17-year-old [[Joran van der Sloot]], a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] honors student living in Aruba and attending the [[International School of Aruba]],<ref name="MSNBC 2005-07-05" /> and his two [[Suriname]]se friends, 21-year-old Deepak Kalpoe<ref name="CNN 2005-06-25" /> and 18-year-old Satish Kalpoe,<ref name="CNN 2005-06-25" /> in Deepak Kalpoe's car.<ref name="CNN 2006-05-31" /><ref name="CBS News 2006-02-17" /> Holloway, who had been scheduled to fly home later on May 30, did not appear for her return flight,<ref name="Court TV 2005-06-08" /> and her packed luggage and passport were found in her Holiday Inn room.<ref name="CNN 2006-05-31" /><ref name="Vanity" /> Aruban authorities initiated searches for Holloway throughout the island and surrounding waters but did not find her.<ref name="CNN 2006-05-31" />

== Investigation ==

=== Early investigation ===

On May 30, 2005, immediately following Holloway's missed flight, Jug and Beth Twitty traveled to Aruba with friends by private jet.<ref name="ABC News 2006-02-23" /> Within four hours of landing in Aruba, the Twittys presented the Aruban police with the name and address of Van der Sloot as the person with whom Holloway left the nightclub.<ref name="ABC News 2006-02-23" /> Beth Twitty has stated that Van der Sloot's full name was given to her by the night manager at the Holiday Inn, who supposedly recognized him on a videotape.<ref name="HansenSearch" /> The Twittys and their friends, with two Aruban policemen, went to the Van der Sloot home looking for Holloway. Van der Sloot initially denied knowing Holloway's name, but he then told the following story, with which Deepak Kalpoe, who was present, agreed:<ref name="Vanity" /> Van der Sloot related that they drove Holloway to the [[California Lighthouse]] area of [[Arashi Beach]] because Holloway wanted to see sharks, before dropping Holloway off at her hotel around 2:00&nbsp;a.m.<ref name="3More" /> According to Van der Sloot, Holloway fell down as she exited the car but refused Van der Sloot's help.<ref name="3More" /> He stated that she was then approached by a dark man in a black shirt similar to those worn by security guards as the young men drove away.<ref name="3More" />

[[File:CarlosnCharlies Oranjestad, Aruba.jpg|thumb|[[Carlos'n Charlie's]], where Holloway was last seen by her classmates, in [[Oranjestad, Aruba]]]]

Searches for Holloway began immediately afterwards. Hundreds of volunteers from Aruba and the United States joined the search. During the first days of the search, the Aruban government gave thousands of civil servants the day off to participate in the search.<ref name="LA Times 2007-06-04" /> Fifty [[Dutch marines]] conducted an extensive search of the shoreline.<ref name="MSNBC 2005-06-06" /> Aruban banks raised $20,000 and provided other support to aid volunteer search teams.<ref name="demonstration" /> Beth Twitty was provided with housing, initially at the Holiday Inn where she stayed in her daughter's former room.<ref name="lighton" /> She subsequently stayed at the nearby [[Wyndham Hotels & Resorts|Wyndham Hotel]]'s presidential suite.<ref name="Vanity" />

Reports indicate Holloway did not appear on any [[security camera]] footage from her hotel's lobby during the course of the night;<ref name="NewDNat" /> however, Beth Twitty has made varying statements as to whether the cameras were actually working that night. According to an April 19, 2006, statement made by her, the security cameras at the Holiday Inn were not working the night Holloway vanished.<ref name="NewDNat" /> Twitty has made other statements indicating that they were working, and has stated so in her book.<ref name="MSNBC 2005-12-05" /><ref name="BethBook" /> In any event, according to Police Commissioner Jan van der Straten, initial head of the investigation until his 2005 retirement, Holloway did not have to go through the lobby to return to her room.<ref name="CNN 2005-06-02" />

The search for physical evidence was extensive and, on occasion, subject to false leads; for example, a possible blood sample taken from Deepak Kalpoe's car was tested but determined not to be blood.<ref name="Fox News 2005-06-13" />

There was heavy involvement by American law enforcement from the early days of the investigation. [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] stated to reporters that the United States was in constant contact with Aruban authorities. Another [[United States Department of State|State Department]] official indicated, "Substantial resources are being applied to this as they <nowiki>[Aruba officials]</nowiki> continue to ask for more".<ref name="Fox News 2005-06-15" />

=== 2005 arrests ===

On June 5, Aruban police detained Nick John and Abraham Jones, former [[security guard]]s<ref name="CBS News 2005-06-09" /> from the nearby Allegro Hotel<ref name="CNN 2005-06-09" /> which was then closed for renovation,<ref name="Fox News 2005-06-04" /> on suspicion of murder and kidnapping.<ref name="MSBNC 2005-06-09" /> The initial reason for their arrests has never been officially disclosed; however, according to news accounts, the Van der Sloot and Kalpoe statements may have been a factor in the arrests.<ref name="Oglesby 2005-06-15" /><ref name="Fox News 2005-06-26" /> Reports also indicate that the two former guards were known for cruising hotels to pick up women, and at least one of them had a prior incident with law enforcement.<ref name="CBS News 2005-06-10" /> John and Jones were released on June 13 without being charged.<ref name="CNN 2005-06-25" />

[[File:Joran van der Sloot Aruba mugshot.jpg|thumb|June 2005 police photograph of [[Joran van der Sloot]]]]

On June 9, 2005, Van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers were arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and murdering Holloway.<ref name="MSNBC 2005-06-13" /> Aruban law allows for arrest on serious suspicion from investigators; to continue holding the suspect in custody, an increasing evidential burden must be met at periodic reviews.<ref name="MSBNC 2005-06-09" /><ref name="AP 2005-07-06" /> According to Dompig, the focus was on these three suspects from the "get-go".<ref name="dompigalcohol" />  Aruba police corps chief Gerald Dompig stated that surveillance of the three began three days after Holloway was reported missing, and included surveillance, telephone wire taps, and even monitoring of their e-mail.<ref name="dompigalcohol" /> Dompig indicated pressure from Holloway's family caused them to stop their surveillance prematurely and to detain the three suspects.<ref name="dompigalcohol" />

As the investigation continued, on June 11, David Cruz, spokesman for the Aruban Minister of Justice, indicated that Natalee Holloway was dead and authorities knew the location of her body.<ref name="Fox News 2005-06-11" /> Cruz later retracted the statement, saying he was a victim of a "misinformation campaign".<ref name="Fox News 2005-06-11" /> That evening, Dompig alleged to the [[Associated Press]] that one of the detained young men admitted "something bad happened" to Holloway after the suspects took her to the beach, and that the suspect was leading police to the scene.<ref name="Fox News 2005-06-11" /> The next morning prosecution spokeswoman Vivian van der Biezen refused to confirm or deny the allegation, simply stating that the investigation was at a "very crucial, very important moment".<ref name="Fox News 2005-06-11" />

On Friday, June 17, a fourth person, later identified as [[disc jockey]] Steve Gregory Croes, was also arrested. Van der Straten told the media that "Croes was detained based on information from one of the other three detainees".<ref name="FNCThree" /> On June 22 Aruban police detained Paulus van der Sloot, Joran van der Sloot's father, for questioning; Paulus van der Sloot was arrested that same day. Both Paulus van der Sloot and Croes were ordered to be released on June 26.<ref name="CNN 2005-06-25" />

During this period the remaining detained suspects' stories changed.<ref name="CNN 2005-06-25" /> All three suspects indicated that Van der Sloot and Holloway were dropped off at the [[Marriott Hotel]] beach near the fishermen's huts. Van der Sloot stated that he did not harm Holloway, but left her on the beach.<ref name="Fox News 2005-08-02" /> According to Satish Kalpoe's attorney, David Kock, Van der Sloot called Deepak Kalpoe to tell the latter that he was walking home, and sent him a text message forty minutes later.<ref name="CNN 2005-06-25" />

At some time during the interrogation Van der Sloot detailed a third account, that he was dropped off at home and Holloway was driven off by the Kalpoe brothers.<ref name="Vanity" /> Dompig discounted the story, stating:

<blockquote>
This latest story [came] when [Van der Sloot] saw the other guys, the Kalpoes, were kind of finger-pointing in his direction, and he wanted to screw them also, by saying he was dropped off. But that story doesn't check out at all. He just wanted to screw Deepak. They had great arguments about this in front of the judge. Because their stories didn't match. This girl, she was from Alabama, she's not going to stay in the car with two black kids. We believe the second story, that they were dropped off by the Marriott.<ref name="Vanity" />
</blockquote>

On Monday, July 4, following hearings before a judge, Deepak and Satish Kalpoe were released, but Joran van der Sloot was detained for an additional sixty days.<ref name="BBC News 2005-06-04" />

=== Continued search, suspects rearrested and released again ===

[[File:NataleeHollowaySearch.jpg|thumb|[[Netherlands Marine Corps|Dutch Marines]] search for Holloway near the [[California Lighthouse]] ]]

On July 4, the Royal Netherlands Air Force deployed three F-16 aircraft equipped with [[infrared]] sensors to aid in the search, without initial result.<ref name="LA Times 2007-06-04" /><ref name="AP 2007-11-22, F16" /> In March 2006 it was reported that satellite photos were being compared with photographs taken more recently (presumably from the F-16s) in an attempt to find unexpected shifts of ground that might be Holloway's grave.<ref name="BBC News 2006-01-17" />

A small pond near the Aruba Racquet Club close to the Marriott Hotel beach was partly drained between July 27 and 30, 2005, after an individual ("the gardener"<ref name="CNN 2005-07-27" />) came forward. According to Jug Twitty, the gardener claimed to have seen Joran van der Sloot attempting to hide his face, driving into the Racquet Club with the two Kalpoes on the morning of May 30 between 2:30&nbsp;a.m. and 3:00&nbsp;a.m.<ref name="CBS News 2005-07-27" /> [[Nancy Grace]] described the gardener as "the man whose testimony cracks the case wide open".<ref name="CNN 2005-08-12" /> Another person, "the jogger",<ref name="Vanity" /> claimed to have seen men burying a blonde-haired woman in a [[landfill]] during the afternoon of May 30.<ref name="MSNBC 2005-07-31" /> The police had searched the landfill in the days following Holloway's disappearance.<ref name="MSNBC 2005-07-31" /> The landfill was searched three times after the jogger's statements, including a search by the FBI with [[Search and rescue dog|cadaver dogs]].<ref name="CNN 2005-08-01" /> The searches were fruitless.<ref name="Vanity" />

On July 25, 2005, the reward for Holloway's safe return was increased from $200,000 to $1,000,000, with a $100,000 reward for information leading to the location of her remains.<ref name="CNN 2005-07-26" /> Following Holloway's disappearance, a reward of $50,000 had been established for her return.<ref name="reward" /> In August 2005, the reward for information as to her remains was increased from $100,000 to $250,000.<ref name="FCN-20050809" />

The FBI announced that Aruban authorities had provided it with documents, suspect interviews, and other evidence. A group from the Aruban police and prosecutor's office traveled to the FBI central laboratory at [[Quantico, Virginia]], to consult with American investigators.<ref name="CNN 2005-07-26" /> After a piece of [[duct tape]] was found with strands of blond hair attached to it, samples were tested both at a Dutch lab and at Quantico.<ref name="CNN 2005-07-18" /> The FBI announced that the hair was not Holloway's.<ref name="CNN 2005-07-29" />

The Kalpoe brothers were rearrested on August 26 along with another new suspect.<ref name="divers" /> According to his lawyer, 21-year-old Freddy Arambatzis was suspected of taking photographs of and having physical contact with an underage girl, an incident which allegedly occurred before the Holloway disappearance and in which Arambatzis's friends Van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers were supposedly involved. Van der Sloot's mother, Anita van der Sloot, stated, "It's a desperate attempt to get the boys to talk. But there is nothing to talk about".<ref name="Fox News 2005-09-01" /> While no public explanation was then made for the Kalpoe rearrests, Dompig later said that it was an unsuccessful attempt to pressure the Kalpoe brothers into confessing.<ref name="Vanity" />

On September 3, 2005, all four of the detained suspects were released by a judge despite the attempts of the prosecution to keep them in custody, on the condition that they remain available to police.<ref name="AMW 2008-02-15" /> On September 14, all restrictions on them were removed by the [[Combined Appeals Court of the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba]].<ref name="timeline1" />

In the months following his release, Joran van der Sloot gave several interviews, expanding upon his version of events, most notably a lengthy interview for [[Fox News]], which aired over three nights in March 2006. During the interview, Van der Sloot indicated that Holloway wanted to have sex with him, but he did not because he did not have a [[condom]].<ref name="ABC News 2006-02-22" /> Van der Sloot stated that Holloway wanted them to stay on the beach, but that he had to go to school in the morning. According to Van der Sloot, he was picked up by Satish Kalpoe at about 3:00&nbsp;am, leaving Holloway sitting on the beach.<ref name="Fox News 2006-03-01" /> In August 2005, David Kock, Satish Kalpoe's attorney, stated that his client had gone to sleep, and had not returned to drive Van der Sloot home.<ref name="Fox News 2005-08-24" /> Van der Sloot stated he was somewhat ashamed to have left a young woman alone on the beach, albeit by her own request, and related that he was not truthful at first because he was convinced Holloway would soon turn up.<ref name="Fox News 2006-03-01" />

The FBI and Aruban authorities interviewed (or in some cases, re-interviewed) several of Holloway's fellow graduates in the United States in January 2006.<ref name="Fox News 2006-01-27" /> On January 17, 2006, Aruban police searched sand dunes on the northwest coast of Aruba in search of Holloway's body, as well as areas close by the Marriott beach.<ref name="CBS News 2006-03-29" /> Additional searches took place in March and April 2006, without result.<ref name="dompigalcohol" />

Shortly before leaving the case, Dompig gave an interview to [[CBS]] correspondent Troy Roberts, which was broadcast on March 25, 2006. In that interview, Dompig stated that he believes Holloway probably died from self-consumed alcohol and/or drug poisoning, was not murdered, and that someone later hid her body. Dompig also stated that Aruba had spent about $3&nbsp;million on the investigation, about 40% of the police operational budget.<ref name="dompigalcohol" /> Dompig indicated that there is evidence that points to possession (though not necessarily use) of drugs by Holloway.<ref name="Alcohol" /><ref name="Fox News 2006-03-24" /> Members of her family have denied drug use by Holloway.<ref name="MSNBC 2006-03-24" />

On April 11, 2006, Dave Holloway published his book recounting the search for his daughter, co-authored with R. Stephanie Good and [[Larry Garrison]], ''[[Aruba: The Tragic Untold Story of Natalee Holloway and Corruption in Paradise]]''.<ref name="DHolloway 2006, ch. Everybody's Child / Aruba" /><ref name="Fox News 2006-04-11" />

=== 2006 arrest of new suspects, the Dutch take over the investigation ===
On April 15, 2006, Geoffrey von Cromvoirt was arrested by Aruban authorities on suspicion of criminal offenses related to [[illegal drug trade|dealing in illegal narcotics]] that, according to the prosecutor, might have been related to the disappearance of Holloway.<ref name="ABC News 2006-04-17" /> At his first court appearance, his detention was extended for eight days. However, Von Cromvoirt was released on April 25, 2006.<ref name="Cromvoirt" /> In addition, another individual with initials "A.B." was arrested on April 22, 2006, but was released the same day.<ref name="Cromvoirt" />

On May 17, 2006, another suspect, Guido Wever, the son of a former Aruban politician, was detained in the Netherlands on suspicion of assisting in the abducting, battering, and killing of Holloway.<ref name="CNN 2006-05-22" /> Wever was questioned for six days in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. While initially Aruban prosecutors sought his transfer to the island, he was instead released by agreement between the prosecutor and Wever's attorney.<ref name="Wever" />

At Aruba's request the Netherlands took over the investigation. A team of the [[Korps landelijke politiediensten|Dutch National Police]] started work on the case in September 2006 following receipt of extensive case documentation in [[Rotterdam]].<ref name="KLPD" /> On April 16, 2007, a combined Aruban–Dutch team began pursuing the investigation in Aruba.<ref name="KLPD" />

=== Book, search, and inspection ===

A book by Joran van der Sloot and reporter Zvezdana Vukojevic, ''[[De zaak Natalee Holloway]]'' (''The Case of Natalee Holloway'') was published, in Dutch, in April 2007.<ref name="Van der Sloot 2007" /> In the book, Van der Sloot gives his perspective of the night Holloway disappeared and the media frenzy which followed. He admits, and apologizes for, his initial untruths, but maintains his innocence.<ref name="ABC/Brouwer 2007-11-28" />

On April 27, 2007, a new search involving some twenty investigators was launched at the Van der Sloot family residence in Aruba.<ref name="AP/Wever 2007-04-27" /><ref name="CNN 2007-04-30" /> Dutch authorities searched the yard and surrounding area, using shovels and thin metal rods to penetrate the dirt.<ref name="AP/Wever 2007-04-27" /> Prosecution spokeswoman Van der Biezen stated, "The investigation has never stopped and the Dutch authorities are completely reviewing the case for new indications".<ref name="AP/Wever 2007-04-27" /> A statement from the prosecutor's office related, "The team has indications that justify a more thorough search".<ref name="AP/Wever 2007-04-27" /> Investigators did not comment on what prompted the new search,<ref name="AP/Wever 2007-04-27" /> except that it was not related to Van der Sloot's book.<ref name="KLPD" /> According to Paulus van der Sloot, "nothing suspicious" was found, and all that was seized were diary entries of him and his wife, and his personal computer—which was subsequently returned.<ref name="CBS News 2007-05-01" />

According to [[Jossy Mansur]], managing editor of Aruba's ''[[Diario (Aruba)|Diario]]'' newspaper, investigators were following up on statements made during early suspect interrogations regarding calls made and emails sent between the Kalpoe brothers and Joran van der Sloot. He also said investigators could be seen examining a laptop at the house.<ref name="NBC News May 2007" />

On May 12, 2007, the Kalpoe family home was subject to an "inspection".<ref name="KBrosNBC" /> The two brothers were detained for about an hour upon objecting to the entry by police and Dutch investigators, but were released when the authorities left.<ref name="KBrosNBC" /><ref name="KBrosFOX" /> According to Kock, the brothers objected to the search because officials did not show them an order justifying the intrusion. A statement from Van der Biezen did not mention what, if anything, officials were searching for, but indicated nothing was removed from the home.<ref name="KBrosNBC" /><ref name="KBrosFOX" /> A subsequent statement from Het Openbaar Ministerie van Aruba (the Aruban prosecutor's office) indicated that the purpose of the visit was to "get a better image of the place or circumstances where an offense may have been committed and to understand the chain of events leading to the offense".<ref name="Antilliaans Dagblad 2007-05-15" /><ref name="RNW 2007-05-14" />

=== 2007 rearrests and re-releases ===

With Aruban investigators citing what was described as newly discovered evidence, Joran van der Sloot and Satish and Deepak Kalpoe were rearrested November 21, 2007, on suspicion of involvement in "[[manslaughter]] and causing serious bodily harm that resulted in the death of Holloway".<ref name="AP 2007-11-22, 3 re-arrested" /> Van der Sloot was detained by Dutch authorities in the Netherlands, while the Kalpoe brothers were detained in Aruba.<ref name="AP 2007-11-22, 3 re-arrested" /> Van der Sloot returned to Aruba and was incarcerated.<ref name="AP 2007-11-22, 3 re-arrested" />

In November 2007, Dave Holloway announced a new search for his daughter, probing the sea beyond the original {{convert|330|ft|m|sing=on}} depths in which earlier searches had taken place.<ref name="AP/Wever 2007-11-22, search" /> That search, involving a vessel called the ''Persistence'', was abandoned due to lack of funds at the end of February 2008 with nothing of significance found.<ref name="sowhatelseisnew" />

On November 30, 2007, a judge ordered the release of Satish and Deepak Kalpoe, despite attempts by the prosecution to extend their detention.<ref name="APKrelease" /><ref name="NovRelease" /> The two brothers were released on the following day.<ref name="CNN 2007-12-01" /> The prosecution appealed the Kalpoes' release. That appeal was denied on December 5, 2007, with the court writing, "Notwithstanding expensive and lengthy investigations on her disappearance and on people who could be involved, the file against the suspect does not contain direct indications that Natalee passed away due to a violent crime."<ref name="USA Today 2007-12-05" /> Van der Sloot was released without charge on December 7, 2007, due to lack of evidence implicating him as well as a lack of evidence that Holloway died as the result of a violent crime. The prosecution indicated it would not appeal.<ref name="CNN 2007-12-07" />

On December 18, 2007, prosecutor Hans Mos officially declared the case closed, and that no charges would be filed due to lack of evidence.<ref name="Newsweek 2008-02-08" /><ref name="People 2007-12-18" /> The prosecution indicated a continuing interest in the Kalpoes and Joran van der Sloot (though they ceased to be legally suspects), and alleged that one of the three, in a chat room message, had stated that Holloway was dead. This was hotly contested by Deepak Kalpoe's attorney, who stated that the prosecution, in translating from [[Papiamento]] to Dutch, had misconstrued a reference to a teacher who had drowned as one to Holloway.<ref name="KBrosUSA" /> Attorney Ronald Wix also stated, "Unless (Mos) finds a body in the bathroom of one of these kids, there's no way in hell they can arrest them anymore."<ref name="ceeya" />

=== Secret cameras, statements, and stories ===

On January 31, 2008, Dutch crime reporter [[Peter R. de Vries]] claimed that he had solved the Holloway case.<ref name="confession" /> De Vries stated that he would tell all on a special television program on Dutch TV on February 3. Beth Twitty's attorney, John Q. Kelly, told [[ABC News]] that he had little faith that the supposed evidence would prove pivotal to the case of her daughter and suggested that it would be quickly debunked.<ref name="confession" />

On February 1, the Dutch media reported that Joran van der Sloot made a confession regarding the disappearance of Natalee Holloway. Later that day, Van der Sloot stated that he was telling the individual what he wanted to hear, and that he had no role in her disappearance.<ref name="denial" /> That same day, the Aruba prosecutor's office announced the reopening of the case.<ref name="ABC News 2008-02-03" />

The broadcast aired February 3, 2008. The broadcast included excerpts from footage recorded from hidden cameras and microphones in the vehicle of Patrick van der Eem, a Dutch businessman and ex-convict,<ref name="stoner" /> who gained Van der Sloot's confidence. Van der Sloot was seen smoking [[marijuana]]<ref name="DutchNews 2008-02-03" /> and stating that he was with Holloway when she began convulsively shaking, then became unresponsive. Van der Sloot stated that he attempted to revive her, without success. He said that he called a friend, who told Van der Sloot to go home and who disposed of the body.<ref name="denial1" /> An individual reputed to be this friend, identified in the broadcast as Daury, has denied Van der Sloot's account, indicating that he was then in [[Rotterdam]] at school.<ref name="daury" />

The Aruban prosecutor's office attempted to obtain an arrest warrant for Van der Sloot based on the tapes; however, a judge denied the request.<ref name="DutchNews 2008-01-04" /> The prosecutor appealed the denial, but the appeal failed on February 14, 2008.<ref name="RNW 2008-02-15" /> The appeals court held that the statements on the tape were inconsistent with evidence in the case and were insufficient to hold Van der Sloot.<ref name="ruling" />

On February 8, 2008, Van der Sloot met with Aruban investigators in the Netherlands. Van der Sloot denied that what he said on the tape was true, stating that he was under the influence of marijuana at the time. Van der Sloot indicated that he still maintains that he left Holloway behind on the beach.<ref name="stoner" />

In March 2008, news reports indicated that the tables had been turned on Van der Eem, who himself was secretly taped after giving an interview for Aruban TV. Van der Eem, under the impression that cameras had been turned off, kept talking. Van der Eem disclosed that he had been a friend of Van der Sloot for years (contradicting his statement on the De Vries show that he had met Van der Sloot in 2007), that he expects to become a millionaire through his involvement in the Holloway case, and that he knew the person who supposedly disposed of Holloway's body—and that Van der Sloot had asked him for two thousand [[euro]]s to buy the man's silence. According to Dutch news service [[Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau|ANP]], Van der Eem, who had already signed a book deal, "was furious" after learning of the taping, and "threatened" the interviewer, who sought legal advice.<ref name="DutchNews 2008-03-07" /> Van der Eem's book ''Overboord'' (''Overboard''),<ref name="nl dictionary" /> co-written with E.E. Byars, was released (in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) on June 25, 2008.<ref name="moreboo" /> Van der Eem was arrested on December 13, 2008 in the Netherlands for allegedly hitting his girlfriend with a crowbar and engaging in risky driving behavior while fleeing police.<ref name="AD Van der Eem" />

The De Vries broadcast was discussed in a seminar by Dutch legal [[psychologist]] Willem Albert Wagenaar, who indicated that the statements did not constitute a confession. Wagenaar criticized De Vries for broadcasting the material, stating that the broadcast made it harder to obtain a conviction, and had De Vries turned over the material to the authorities without broadcasting it, they would have held "all the trumps" in questioning Van der Sloot. Wagenaar opined that not only was the case not solved, it was not even clear that a crime had been committed. Professor Crisje Brants, in the same seminar, also criticized De Vries's methods.<ref name="RNW 2008-02-11" />

On November 24, 2008, [[Fox News]] aired an interview with Van der Sloot in which he alleged that he sold Holloway into [[sexual slavery]], receiving money both when Holloway was taken, and later on to keep quiet. Van der Sloot also alleged that his father paid off two police officers who had learned that Holloway was taken to [[Venezuela]]. Van der Sloot later retracted the statements made in the interview.<ref name="Fox News 2008-11-24" /> The show also aired part of an audio recording provided by Van der Sloot, which he alleged is a phone conversation between him and his father, in which the father displays knowledge of his son's purported involvement in human trafficking. According to Mos, this voice heard on the recording is not that of Paulus van der Sloot—the Dutch newspaper ''[[De Telegraaf]]'' reports that the 'father's' voice is almost certainly that of Joran van der Sloot himself, trying to speak in a lower tone.<ref name="Telegraaf" /> Paulus van der Sloot died of a heart attack on February 10, 2010.<ref name="RNW 2010-02-11" />

On March 20, 2009, Dave Holloway flew a search dog to Aruba to search a small [[reservoir]] in northern Aruba, previously identified by a supposed witness as a possible location of Natalee's remains. Aruban authorities indicated that they had no new information in the case, but that Holloway had been given permission to conduct the search.<ref name="MSNBC 2009-03-20" />

On February 23, 2010, it was reported that Joran van der Sloot had stated in an interview (first offered to [[RTL Group]] in 2009) that he had disposed of Holloway's body in a [[marsh]] on Aruba. New chief prosecutor Peter Blanken indicated that authorities had investigated the latest story, and had dismissed it. Blanken stated that "The locations, names, and times he gave just did not make sense".<ref name="MSNBC 2010-02-23" />

Underwater searches were conducted by Aruban authorities in March 2010 after an American couple reported<ref name="National Ledger 2010-03-27" /> that while snorkeling they had photographed what they thought might be human skeletal remains, possibly those of Holloway. Aruban authorities sent divers to investigate, but no remains were recovered.<ref name="CNN 2010-03-24" />

=== Van der Sloot's extortion of money from Holloway's family ===

On March 29, 2010, Van der Sloot contacted John Q. Kelly, legal representative of Beth Twitty, with an offer to reveal the location of Holloway's body and the circumstances surrounding her death for an advance of [[United States dollar|US$]]25,000 against a total of $250,000.<ref name="CNN-interpol-extortion" /> After Kelly notified the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], they arranged to proceed with the transaction.<ref name="Fox-20100611-holloway" /><ref name="ET-20100609-fbi" /> On May 10, Van der Sloot had $15,000 [[wire transfer]]red to his account in the Netherlands, following the receipt of $10,000 in cash that was videotaped by undercover investigators in Aruba.<ref name="Fox-extortion-details" /> Authorities state that the information that he provided in return was false because the house in which he said Holloway's body was located had not yet been built at the time of her disappearance.<ref name="CNN-20100609-sting" /> On June 3, Van der Sloot was charged in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama|U.S. District Court of Northern Alabama]] with [[extortion]] and [[wire fraud]].<ref name="WSFA-extortion" /> [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]] [[Joyce White Vance]] obtained an [[arrest warrant]] and transmitted it to [[Interpol]].<ref name="interpol Van Der Sloot wanted" /><ref name="CNN-alabama" /> Van der Sloot was indicted on the charges on June 30.<ref name="WHNT-20100630-indict" />

On June 4, at the request of the [[United States Justice Department|U.S. Justice Department]], authorities raided and confiscated items from two homes in the Netherlands, one of them belonging to reporter [[Jaap Amesz]] who had previously interviewed Van der Sloot and claimed knowledge of criminal activities by Van der Sloot.<ref name="AOL-holloways-mom" /> Aruban investigators used information gathered from the extortion case to launch a new search at a beach, but no new evidence was found.<ref name="GMA-20100611-rotten" /> Dave Holloway returned to Aruba on June 14 to pursue possible new clues.<ref name="AP-20100614-aruba" />

=== Van der Sloot kills in Peru ===

On May 30, 2010—five years to the day after Holloway's disappearance—[[Stephany Tatiana Flores Ramírez]], a 21-year-old business student, was reported missing in [[Lima]], [[Peru]]. She was found dead three days later in a hotel room registered in Van der Sloot's name.<ref name="CNN-Google" /> Van der Sloot was arrested on June 3 in [[Chile]] and was [[Extradition|extradited]] to Peru the next day.<ref name="AP-in-peru" /> On June 7, 2010, Peruvian authorities said that Van der Sloot confessed to killing Flores Ramírez after he lost his temper because she accessed his laptop without permission and found information linking him to the disappearance of Holloway.<ref name="CNN-Holloway-link" /> Police chief Cesar Guardia related that Van der Sloot told Peruvian police that he knows where Holloway's body is and offered to help Aruban authorities find it.<ref name="Fox-20100611-holloway" /><ref name="CNN 2010-06-11" /> However, Guardia stated that the interrogation was limited to their case in Peru, and that questions about Holloway's disappearance were avoided.<ref name="FWST 2010-06-10" /> On June 11, Van der Sloot was charged in Lima Superior Court with [[murder|first-degree murder]] and [[robbery]].<ref name="CBS5-20100611-charged" /> On June 15, Aruban and Peruvian authorities announced an agreement to cooperate and allow investigators from Aruba to interview Van der Sloot at [[National Penitentiary Institute (Peru)|Miguel Castro Castro]] prison in Peru.<ref name="CNN 2010-06-15" /> In a September 2010 interview from the prison, Van der Sloot reportedly admitted to the extortion plot, stating: "I wanted to get back at Natalee's family—her parents have been making my life tough for five years."<ref name="MSNBC 2010-09-06" /> Van der Sloot pleaded guilty to murdering Ramirez on January 11, 2012,<ref name="Rawls 2012-01-12" /> and was sentenced to 28 years in prison.<ref name="CNN 2012-01-13" />

On November 12, 2010, tourists found a jawbone on an Aruban beach near the Phoenix Hotel and Bubali Swamp.<ref name="MSNBC 2010-11-16" /> Aruban prosecutor Peter Blanken stated that a preliminary examination by a forensic expert on the island determined that the bone was from a young woman.<ref name="CNN 2010-11-16" /> A part of the bone was sent to [[The Hague]] for testing by the [[Netherlands Forensic Institute]].<ref name="CNN 2010-11-16" /><ref name="DutchNews 2010-11-16" /> On November 23, 2010, Aruba Solicitor-General Taco Stein announced that, based on dental records, the jawbone was not from Holloway, and it was not possible to determine whether it had come from a man or woman.<ref name="CNN 2010-11-23" />

=== Holloway declared dead ===

In June 2011, Dave Holloway filed a petition with the Alabama courts seeking to have his daughter declared legally dead. The papers were served on his former wife, who announced her intention to oppose the petition.<ref name="ABC News 2011-09-14" /> A hearing was held on September 23, 2011, during which Probate Judge Alan King ruled Dave Holloway had met the requirements for a legal presumption of death.<ref name="Rawls 2011-09-23" /> On January 12, 2012, a second hearing was held, after which Judge King signed the order declaring Natalee Holloway to be dead.<ref name="Rawls 2012-01-12" />

== Beth Twitty's involvement ==

Beth Twitty has alleged in televised interviews that Joran van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers know more than they have told, and that at least one of them sexually assaulted or raped her daughter.<ref name="CBS News 2005-10-06" /> Twitty stated that  she received copies of police statements stating that Joran van der Sloot admitted having sex with Holloway at his home and described intimate details of her. She has never released copies of the alleged statement, though she characterizes them as admissions of "sexual assault" and Vinda de Sousa, former Holloway–Twitty family Aruban attorney, has indicated that no such admission was made.<ref name="MSNBC 2006-04-20" /> In addition, Dompig denied that any such statement was made, stating that Van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers consistently denied having sex with Holloway.<ref name="dompigreaction" />

On June 12, 2005, three days after the arrest of Joran van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers, and in response to a nationally televised address by Aruba Prime Minister [[Nelson Oduber]] reaffirming Aruba's commitment to solving the case, Twitty stated, "I'm not getting any answers".<ref name="NotAnswers" /> She added, "I don't feel any further along than the day I got here".<ref name="NotAnswers" /> Twitty stated that her complaints were not addressed specifically at the Aruban government, but arose from frustration at not knowing what happened to her daughter.<ref name="NotAnswers" />

On July 5, 2005, following the initial release of the Kalpoes, Twitty alleged, "Two suspects were released yesterday who were involved in a violent crime against my daughter",<ref name="demonstration" /> and referred to the Kalpoes as "criminals".<ref name="AP 2005-07-06" /> A demonstration involving about two hundred Arubans took place that evening outside the courthouse in Oranjestad in anger over Twitty's remarks, with signs reading "Innocent until proven guilty" and "Respect our Dutch laws or go home".<ref name="AP 2005-07-06" /><ref name="MomApologizes" /> On July 8, 2005, and after Satish Kalpoe's attorney threatened legal action over Twitty's allegations, which he described as "prejudicial, inflammatory, libelous, and totally outrageous", Twitty read a statement that said her remarks were fueled by "despair and frustration" and that she "apologize{{bracket|d}} to the Aruban people and to the Aruban authorities if I or my family offended you in any way".<ref name="MomApologizes" />

Twitty was criticized for her focus on Joran van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers, to the exclusion of any other theory as to what happened to Holloway. According to the lawsuit filed by the Kalpoe brothers, she has (on various television programs) repeatedly accused them, and Joran van der Sloot, of "sexual assault" and "gang rape" of her daughter.<ref name="KatrinaCloak" /><ref name="USA Today 2005-09-27" />

Twitty was also criticized for making what have been deemed to be inconsistent and contradictory statements (for example, as to whether there were operating security cameras at the Holiday Inn). According to Julia Renfro, U.S.-born editor of the Aruban tourist-oriented newspaper, ''Aruba Today'', who befriended Twitty in the early days of the investigation, Twitty pandered to [[tabloid television]] and her "behavior was odd from the get-go".<ref name="LA Times 2007-06-04" /> Renfro noted that "Twitty immediately concluded that her daughter had been [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] and made no effort to check hospitals or police",<ref name="Renfronoted" /> adding that within a couple of days, after fixing responsibility on Joran van der Sloot, Twitty "was telling TV interviewers that she knew her daughter had been gang-raped and [[murder]]ed".<ref name="Renfronoted" />

Her book ''[[Loving Natalee: A Mother's Testament of Hope and Faith]]'',<ref name="BethBook" /> was published on October 2, 2007 under the name "Beth Holloway," which she resumed using following her December 2006 divorce from Jug Twitty.<ref name="BethBook" /><ref name="MSNBC 2007_" />

| What we want is, we want justice. And you know—and we have to recognize the fact that, you know, this crime has been committed on the island of Aruba, and we know the perpetrators. We know it's these suspects, Deepak and Satish Kalpoe and Joran Van Der Sloot. And you know, we just have to, though, keep going, Nancy, because the only way we will get justice for Natalee is if we do keep going. I mean, if we give up, absolutely nothing will happen. Nothing.

Following the airing of the De Vries program, Beth Holloway, adhering to the position that the tapes represent the way events transpired, told the ''[[New York Post]]'' that she believes her daughter might still be alive if Van der Sloot had called for help. She contends that Van der Sloot dumped Holloway's body, possibly alive, into the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]].<ref name="Fox News 2008-02-05" /> Holloway also alleges that the individual Joran van der Sloot supposedly called that evening was his father, Paulus, who, according to Holloway, "orchestrated what to do next".<ref name="Deadlineclose" /> She, and Dave Holloway, alleged that Joran van der Sloot was receiving "special legal favors".<ref name="Deadlineclose" /> After the court decision not to rearrest Van der Sloot was affirmed, Beth Holloway stated, "I think that what I do take comfort in, his life is a living hell",<ref name="NBC 13 2008-02-15" /> later adding, "I'd be good with a ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]'' prison anywhere for Joran."<ref name="Fox News 2008-11-19" />

In response to her daughter's disappearance, Beth Holloway founded the International Safe Travels Foundation,<ref name="Fox News 2007-01-05" /> a [[non-profit organization]] designed "to inform and educate the public to help them travel more safely as they travel internationally".<ref name="ISTF Mission" /> She has marketed herself as a for-fee speaker through the Nashville Speakers Bureau.<ref name="Nashville Speakers Bureau, Beth Holloway" /> In April 2010, Holloway announced plans for a service called "Mayday 360", to intervene immediately when young people get into trouble overseas. She stated that if necessary, former federal agents with specific knowledge of a country could be dispatched there.<ref name="NYPost 2010-04-05" /> In May 2010, she announced that the Natalee Holloway Resource Center would open at the [[National Museum of Crime & Punishment]]. Located in [[Washington, D.C.]], the center opened on June 8 to aid families of missing persons.<ref name="AP 2010-05-28" />

Though Beth Holloway made television appearances as new developments arose in the case, she is under FBI direction not to discuss her daughter's case or that of [[Stephany Flores Ramírez]].<ref name="WTOK-center" />

== Criticism of the investigation ==

[[File:NataleeHollowayWall-female.jpg|thumb|left|Young woman signs a prayer wall erected in support of Holloway]]

The Twittys and their supporters criticized a perceived lack of progress by Aruban police.<ref name="Geiss 2005-10-06" /><ref name="CDNNCott" /> The Twittys' own actions in Aruba were also criticized, and the Twittys were accused of actively stifling any evidence that might impugn Holloway's character by asking her fellow students to remain silent about the case and using their access to the media to push their own version of events. The Twittys denied this.<ref name="Vanity" />

While initially the Twittys discouraged a travel boycott of Aruba, this changed by September 2005. Beth Twitty urged that persons not travel to Aruba and other Dutch territories because of what she stated were tourist safety issues. Alabama [[Governor]] [[Bob Riley (Alabama)|Bob Riley]], joined by the Twittys, urged Alabamians and others to boycott Aruba on November 8, 2005, in a news conference.<ref name="USA Today 2005-11-21" /> Riley also wrote to other United States governors seeking their support—the governors of Georgia and Arkansas eventually joined in the call for boycott. The Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, city council voted to ask the governor of Pennsylvania to call for a boycott.<ref name="Jamaica Observer 2005-11-11" /> The governor did not join in the call for a boycott, and no federal support was given.<ref name="USA Today 2005-11-21" /><ref name="NatSupport" />

The boycott was supported by some of Alabama's Congressional delegation, including both senators and Congressman [[Spencer Bachus]] (R-AL), who represents Mountain Brook. Senator [[Richard Shelby]] (R-AL) voiced his support for the boycott in a letter to the [[American Society of Travel Agents]].<ref name="RitaTranCott" /> Shelby stated, "For the safety, security and wellbeing of our citizens, I do not believe that we can trust that we will be protected while in Aruba".<ref name="RitaTranCott" /> Prime Minister Oduber stated that Aruban investigators have done their best to solve the mystery, and responded to the call for boycott, "This is a preposterous and irresponsible act. We are not guerillas. We are not terrorists. We don't pose a threat to the United States, nor to Alabama".<ref name="Oduber" />

Members of the Aruba Hotel and Tourism Association, the Aruba Tourism Authority, the Aruba Hospitality and Security Foundation, the Aruban Chamber of Commerce and government figures, including Public Relations Representative Ruben Trapenberg, formed an "Aruba Strategic Communications Task Force" to respond collectively to what they perceived to be unfounded and/or negative portrayals of the island.<ref name="Aruba.com taskforce" /> The group issued press releases and sent representatives to appear in news media. They joined the Aruban government in opposing the calls for a boycott of the island.<ref name="Vanity" />

=== Skeeters tape and Dr. Phil; lawsuits ===

On September 15, 2005, the ''[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil]]'' television show showed parts of a hidden-camera interview with Deepak Kalpoe in which Kalpoe seems to answer "She did. You'd be surprised how easy it was" to a suggestion that Holloway had sex with all three men.<ref name="CBS News 2005-10-06" /> The taping had been instigated by Jamie Skeeters, a private investigator. When the tape was broadcast, news reports indicated an expectation of a rearrest, which Dompig termed a "strong possibility" if the tapes were legitimate.<ref name="dompigreaction" />

Aruban police subsequently provided a fuller version of the relevant part of the tape in which Kalpoe's response differed from the ''[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil]]'' version, apparently due to editing that may have altered the meaning of what was said.<ref name="CNN 2005-12-01" /> An unofficial Aruban-affiliated spokesperson and commentator on the case said videotape showed Kalpoe had shaken his head and said "No, she didn't.", thereby denying that Holloway had sex with him and the other two men.  According to an [[MSNBC]] report, the crucial words are inaudible, and presenter Rita Cosby questioned if it could be substantiated that Kalpoe had ever made the statements attributed to him in the ''[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil]]'' version's transcript of the secret recording.<ref>{{Citation|title = Rita Cosby Live & Direct|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/10281941/ns/msnbc-rita_cosby_specials/t/rita-cosby-live-direct-nov-th/|date = November 30, 2005|publisher = MSNBC|quote = You know, Clint, are we ever going to know sort of what those words are?  And do you think it's something that the FBI—my understanding is—when Jamie was on this show, he did say that the FBI had just picked up the tape.  I think that was about a week or two ago.  Why don't we hear from the FBI to sort of settle this out?}}</ref>

In December 2006, the Kalpoes filed a slander and libel suit against Dr. Phil and Skeeters (who died in January 2007)<ref name="LA Times 2007-06-04" /> in Los Angeles.<ref name="lawsuit" /> Beth Twitty and Dave Holloway responded by filing a wrongful death lawsuit against the Kalpoes in the same venue. The wrongful death suit was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction on June 1, 2007;<ref name="lawsuit" /> the libel and slander case was initially set for trial on October 12, 2011<ref name="SFGate 2011-05-05" /> but was later set for April 2015.<ref>http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/dr-phil-cbs-gain-advantage-688038</ref> An earlier lawsuit had been filed in New York City by the parents against Paulus and Joran van der Sloot and served on them on a visit to New York. The case had been dismissed in August 2006 as filed in an inconvenient forum.<ref name="lawsuit2" />

On November 10, 2005, Paulus van der Sloot won an unjust detention action against the Aruban government, clearing him as a suspect and allowing him to retain his government contract.<ref name="timeline1" /> The elder Van der Sloot then brought a second action, seeking monetary damages for himself and his family because of his false arrest.<ref name="UPI 2006-08-04" /><ref name="AP 2006-08-08" /> The action was initially successful, but the award of damages was reversed on appeal.<ref name="Expatica 2007-02-15" />

=== ''Amigoe'' article ===
The ''Amigoe'' reported on interviews with Renfro and Dompig in which they said that Aruban authorities had been systematically obstructed in their investigation by US officials. They also said that within a day of Holloway being declared missing, a [[medjet]], unauthorized by Aruban authorities, had arrived on Aruba and had remained for several days for the purpose of covertly taking Holloway off the island without notifying local authorities.<ref name="Amigoe" /> Renfro also said she and Beth Twitty received a phone call from an unknown woman on June 2, 2005 asking for money in return for  her giving Holloway's location, and asserting that Holloway was  unwilling to return to her mother. According to Renfro, she and another American went to a drug house where Holloway supposedly was, bringing money, but found that Jug Twitty had already been to the area, spreading "a lot of uproar and panic in the direct vicinity", and nothing could be accomplished.<ref name="Amigoe" /> The Twittys disputed Renfo's accounts, Beth describing Renfro as "a witch".<ref name="Vanity" />

=== Film adaptation ===
{{main article|Natalee Holloway (film)}}

On April 19, 2009, [[LMN (TV channel)|Lifetime Movie Network]] aired ''[[Natalee Holloway (film)|Natalee Holloway]]'', a [[television film]] based on Beth Holloway's book ''Loving Natalee''.<ref name="UPI 2008-10-07" /> Starring [[Tracy Pollan]] as Beth Holloway-Twitty, [[Grant Show]] as George "Jug" Twitty, [[Amy Gumenick]] as Natalee Holloway and Jacques Strydom as Joran van der Sloot, the film retells events leading up to the night of Holloway's disappearance in 2005, and the ensuing investigation in the aftermath. It was shot in South Africa.<ref>http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2009-03-12-pollan-natalee-holloway_N.htm</ref>

The movie does not solve the case, but stages re-creations of various scenarios, based on the testimony of key players and suspects, including Van der Sloot. The broadcast of the film attracted 3.2 million viewers, garnering the highest [[Nielsen ratings|television ratings]] in the network's 11-year history.<ref name="Variety/Kissel 2009-04-20" /> Although it set ratings records for Lifetime, the movie received mixed reviews from critics. Alec Harvey of ''[[The Birmingham News]]'' called the movie "sloppy and uneven, a forgettable look at the tragedy that consumed the nation's attention for months".<ref name="Harvey 2009-04-17" /> However, Jake Meaney of ''[[PopMatters]]'' found the film to be surprisingly "calm and levelheaded", and praised Tracy Pollan's portrayal of Holloway's mother.<ref name="PopMatters-review" /> A follow up film, ''Justice for Natalee Holloway,'' aired in mid-2011 on the Lifetime Movie Network. This film picks up in 2010, on the five year anniversary of Natalee's disappearance. It continues to center on the investigation and what exactly happened to the Alabama teen.

[[File:NataleeHollowayWall-NewsCrews.jpg|thumb|[[News crew]]s covering the Holloway disappearance, June 10, 2005]]

[[List of United States over-the-air television networks|U.S. television networks]] devoted much air time to the search for Holloway, the investigation of her disappearance, and rumors surrounding the case. [[Greta Van Susteren]], host of [[Fox News Channel]]'s ''[[On the Record with Greta Van Susteren|On the Record]]'', and [[Nancy Grace]] on her eponymous [[Headline News]] program were among the most prominent television personalities to devote time to the incident. Van Susteren's almost continuous coverage of the story caused ''On the Record'' to get its best ratings to date,<ref name="SPTimes 2005-08-22" /> while Grace's show became the cornerstone of the new "Headline Prime" block on Headline News, which ran two episodes (a live show and a repeat) every night during prime-time. As the case wore on, much of the attention was given to Beth Twitty and her statements.<ref name="NBC/Kosinski 2005-08-24" /> Aruban government spokesman Ruben Trapenberg stated, "The case is under a microscope, and the world is watching."<ref name="lighton" />

The saturation of coverage triggered a backlash among some critics who argued that such extensive media attention validates the "[[missing white woman syndrome]]" theory, which argues that missing-person cases involving [[White people|white]] women and girls receive disproportionate attention in the media compared with cases involving white males or people of color. [[CNN]] ran a segment criticizing the amount of coverage their competitors gave to the story despite what they characterized as a lack of new items to report, with CNN news anchor [[Anderson Cooper]] calling the coverage "downright ridiculous".<ref name="CNN 2005-08-11" />

Early in the case, political commentator and columnist [[Arianna Huffington]] wrote, "If you were to get your news only from television, you'd think the top issue facing our country right now is an 18-year-old girl named Natalee who went missing in Aruba. Every time one of these stories comes up, like, say, [[Michael Jackson]], when it's finally over I think, what a relief, now we can get back to real news. But we never do."<ref name="BBC News 2005-06-25" />

In March 2008, ''[[Diario (Aruba)|El Diario]]'' commented, "But if doubts persist about cases involving missing [[Latino|Latinas]], there are reasons why. These cases rarely receive the attention and resources we see given to other missing persons. The English-language media, for example, appear to be focused on the stories of missing white women, such as with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway in Aruba. Cases of missing Latina and [[African American]] women often remain faceless, when they are even covered."<ref name="Latin" />

[[CBS]] senior journalist Danna Walker stated, "There is criticism that it is only a story because she is a pretty blonde—and white<!-- punctuation of verbal quote corrected, original transcription is " ... because she is a pretty, blonde, and white&nbsp;... -->—and it is criticism that journalists are taking to heart and looking elsewhere for other stories. But it is a big story because it is an American girl who went off on an adventure, and didn't come back. It is a huge mystery, it is something people can identify with."<ref name="BBC News 2005-06-25" />

''[[Good Morning America]]'' anchor [[Chris Cuomo]] was unapologetic of his program's extensive coverage of the Holloway case. "I don't believe it's my role to judge what people want to watch&nbsp;… If they say, 'I want to know what happened to this girl'&nbsp;… I want to help them find out."<ref name="Cuomo" />

Holloway's family, however, instead criticized the lessening of coverage of the young woman's disappearance. The saturation coverage of Holloway's disappearance by the American media was largely eclipsed in late August 2005 by [[Hurricane Katrina]].<ref name="KatrinaCloak" /><ref name="DHolloway 2006, p. 124" /> Beth Twitty and Dave Holloway alleged that Aruba took advantage of the extensive coverage of the hurricane to release the suspects.<ref name="KatrinaCloak" /> However, the deadline for judicial review of Joran van der Sloot's detention was set long before the hurricane.<ref name="timeline1" />

Lamented Dave Holloway in his book,

{{quote
| Hurricane Katrina had left the door open for the boys to be sent on their way with little publicity and few restrictions because it took the world's focus off of Natalee, but only for a brief time. The huge amount of publicity had waned and, during that time of quiet for us, Joran and the Kalpoe brothers were sent home&nbsp;... All of the news shows that had followed our every move only a day before had now become fixated on the next big ratings grabber: the victims of Hurricane Katrina.<ref name="DHolloway 2006, p. 124" />
