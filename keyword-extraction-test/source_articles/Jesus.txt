  PLEASE READ THIS FIRST.
  The following references are WP:RS sources which are used per WP:RS/AC guideline.
  The issue has been discussed on the talk page at length
  See the "talk page FAQ" about it; it may answer your question.

  The main source says "scholars of antiquity", other sources say "scholars", "biblical scholars and classical historians" and "historians".

  Sources do not say "X scholars" or "Christian scholars", so do not modify it as such, for that will make it deviate from what the sources state.
  The source says "virtually all", so do NOT change it to "most", "several", "many", etc.

  Thank you.

Most scholars agree, following what is known as the "Marcan hypothesis", that the authors of Matthew and Luke used Mark as a source when writing their gospels. Matthew and Luke also share some content not found in Mark. To explain this, many scholars believe that in addition to Mark, another source (commonly called the "[[Q source]]") was used by the two authors.{{sfn|Licona|2010|pp=210–21}}

According to a broad scholarly consensus, the Synoptic Gospels, and not John, are the primary sources of historical information about Jesus.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=71}}{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=17–62}}<ref name=Britannica /> However, not everything contained in the New Testament gospels is considered to be historically reliable.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=3}} Elements whose historical authenticity is disputed include the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]], the [[Massacre of the Innocents]], the Resurrection, the Ascension, Jesus' miracles, and the [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|Sanhedrin trial]], among others.{{sfn|Crossan|Watts|1999|p=108}}{{sfn|Dunn|2003|pp=779–781}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Funk |first=Robert W. | title=The acts of Jesus: the search for the authentic deeds of Jesus |year=1998 |publisher=Harper |pages=449–495 |isbn=978-0-06-062979-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Bart D. |last=[[Ehrman|Ehrman, Bart D.]]|title=Jesus: Apocalyptic prophet of the new millennium |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1999 |p=193–197}} "... historians do not deny the possibility of miracles or deny that miracles have actually happened in the past.

Historians, according to Gerd Theissen, are right to be skeptical of miracles such as walking on water, but exorcisms and healings are well-documented in many cultures and should be considered possible.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=310}} 
Views on the gospels range from their being [[inerrancy|inerrant]] descriptions of the life of Jesus{{sfn|Grudem|1994|pp=90–91}} to their providing little historical information about his life beyond the basics.{{sfn|Köstenberger|Kellum|Quarles|2009|pp=117–125}}{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=22–23}}

The Synoptics emphasize different aspects of Jesus. In Mark, Jesus is the [[Son of God (Christianity)|Son of God]] whose mighty works demonstrate the presence of [[God's Kingdom]].<ref name="May Metzger Mark"/> He is a tireless wonder worker, the servant of both God and man.<ref name="ThompsonPortraits">Thompson, Frank Charles.

The Synoptics and John agree on the main outline of Jesus' life. John the Baptist precedes Jesus, their ministries overlap, and John witnesses to Jesus' identity. Jesus teaches and performs miracles, at least partly in Galilee. He then visits Jerusalem, where the leaders have him crucified, and he is buried. After his tomb is found empty on Sunday, the risen Jesus presents himself to his followers.{{sfn|Cross|2005 |loc=John, Gospel of}}

The [[John 1:1|prologue to the Gospel of John]] identifies Jesus as an incarnation of the divine Word ([[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]).<ref name = MayMetzgerJohn>May, Herbert G. and Bruce M. Metzger. The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha. 1977. "John" p. 1286-1318.</ref>
As the Word, Jesus was eternally present with God, active in all creation, and the source of humanity's moral and spiritual nature.<ref name = MayMetzgerJohn/> With this prologue, the evangelist establishes that Jesus is not only greater than any past human prophet but greater than any prophet could be. He not only speaks God's Word; he is God's Word.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=302–310}} In the Gospel of John, Jesus reveals his divine role publicly. Here he is the Bread of Life, the Light of the World, the True Vine and more.<ref name="ThompsonPortraits"/>

One important aspect of the study of the gospels is the [[literary genre]] under which they fall. Genre "is a key convention guiding both the composition and the interpretation of writings".<ref>Burridge, R. A. (2006). Gospels. In J. W. Rogerson & Judith M. Lieu (Eds) ''The Oxford Handbook of Biblical Studies''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 433</ref> Whether the gospel authors set out to write novels, myths, histories, or biographies has a tremendous impact on how they ought to be interpreted. Some recent studies suggest that the genre of the gospels ought to be situated within the realm of ancient [[biography]].<ref>Talbert, C. H. (1977). ''What is a Gospel?

In general, the authors of the New Testament showed little interest in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age.{{sfn|Rahner|2004|pp=730–731}} As stated in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#21:25|John 21:25]], the gospels do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in the life of Jesus.<ref>{{cite book|title=Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus|last=O'Collins|first=Gerald|year= 2009 |isbn= 978-0-19-955787-5 |pages= 1–3 |publisher=OUP Oxford}}</ref> The accounts were primarily written as theological documents in the context of [[early Christianity]], with timelines as a secondary consideration.<ref name=Wiarda75 >{{cite book|title=Interpreting Gospel Narratives: Scenes, People, and Theology|first=Timothy |last=Wiarda |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-8054-4843-6 |pages= 75–78 |publisher= B&H Publishing Group}}</ref> One manifestation of the gospels as theological documents rather than historical chronicles is that they devote about one third of their text to just seven days, namely the last week of the life of Jesus in [[Jerusalem]], referred to as [[Passion (Christianity)|the Passion]].<ref name=Turner613 >{{cite book|title=Matthew|first=David L. |last=Turner|year= 2008| isbn= 978-0-8010-2684-3 |page= 613 |publisher= Baker Academic}}</ref> Although the gospels do not provide enough details to satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates, it is possible to draw from them a general picture of the life story of Jesus.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=3}}{{sfn|Rahner|2004|pp=730–731}}<ref name=Wiarda75 />

Matthew and Luke each describe Jesus' nativity (or birth), especially that Jesus was born of a virgin in [[Bethlehem]] in fulfillment of prophecy.

Later, Jesus identifies John as "the Elijah who was to come" ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#11:14|Matthew 11:14]], [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#9:13|Mark 9:13-14]]), the prophet who was expected to arrive before the "great and terrible day of the Lord" ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Malachi#4:5|Malachi 4:5]]). Likewise, Luke says that John had the spirit and power of Elijah ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#1:17|Luke 1:17]]).

In Mark, John baptizes Jesus, and as he comes out of the water he sees the Holy Spirit descending to him like a dove and he hears a voice from heaven declaring him to be God's son (Mark 1:9–11). This is one of two events described in the gospels where a voice from Heaven calls Jesus "Son", the other being the Transfiguration.{{sfn|Lee|2004|pp=21–30}}<ref name="Nobbs"/> The spirit then drives him into the wilderness where he is tempted by Satan (Mark 1:12–13). Jesus then begins his ministry after John's arrest (Mark 1:14). Jesus' baptism in Matthew is similar. Here, before Jesus' baptism, John protests, saying, "I need to be baptized by you" (Matthew 3:14). Jesus instructs him to carry on with the baptism "to fulfill all righteousness" (Matthew 3:15). Matthew also details the three temptations that Satan offers Jesus in the wilderness (Matthew 4:3–11). In Luke, the Holy Spirit descends as a dove after everyone has been baptized and Jesus is praying ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:21|Luke 3:21-22]]). John implicitly recognizes Jesus from prison after sending his followers to ask about him (Luke 7:18–23). Jesus' baptism and temptation serve as preparation for his public ministry.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sheen|first=Fulton J.|title=Life of Christ|year=2008|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-385-52699-9|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KyqQKohpVR4C&pg=PA65#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>

The Gospel of John leaves out Jesus' baptism and temptation.{{sfn|Cross|2005 |loc=Jesus Christ}} Here, John the Baptist testifies that he saw the Spirit descend on Jesus ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#1:32|John 1:32]]).<ref name="Zanzig"/>{{sfn|Boring|Craddock|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=N0tLXRIiIe0C&lpg=PA292&pg=PA292#v=onepage&q=%22the%20baptist%22&f=false 292]}} John publicly proclaims Jesus as the sacrificial Lamb of God, and some of John's followers become disciples of Jesus.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=17–62}} In this Gospel, John denies that he is Elijah ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#1:21|John 1:21]]). Before John is imprisoned, Jesus leads his followers to baptize disciples as well (John 3:22-24), and they baptize more people than John (John 4:1).

The Synoptics depict two distinct geographical settings in Jesus' ministry. The first takes place north of Judea in Galilee, where Jesus conducts a successful ministry; and the second shows Jesus rejected and killed when he travels to Jerusalem.<ref name="ISBEO"/> Often referred to as "[[rabbi]]",<ref name="ISBEO"/> Jesus preaches his message orally.<ref name="Dunn2013"/> Notably, Jesus forbids those who recognize his identity as the Messiah to speak of it, including people he heals and demons he exorcises (see [[Messianic Secret]]).{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=285–296}}

John depicts Jesus' ministry as largely taking place in and around Jerusalem rather than in Galilee. In this Gospel, Jesus' divine identity is publicly proclaimed and immediately recognized.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=302–310}}

Scholars divide the ministry of Jesus into several stages. The Galilean ministry begins when Jesus returns to Galilee from the Judaean Desert after rebuffing the temptation of [[Satan]]. Jesus preaches around Galilee, and in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#4:18|Matthew 4:18–20]], [[first disciples of Jesus|his first disciples]], who will eventually form the core of the early Church, encounter him and begin to travel with him.{{sfn|McGrath|2006|pp=16–22}}{{sfn|Redford|2007|pp=117–130}} This period includes the Sermon on the Mount, one of Jesus' major discourses,{{sfn|Redford|2007|pp=117–130}}<ref>{{cite book|title=The Sermon on the mount: a theological investigation|first=Carl G.|last= Vaught|year=2001 |publisher=Baylor University Press |isbn =978-0-918954-76-3 |pages= xi–xiv}}</ref> as well as the [[calming the storm|calming of the storm]], the [[feeding the multitude|feeding of the 5,000]], [[Jesus' walk on water|walking on water]] and a number of other miracles and [[parables of Jesus|parables]].{{sfn|Redford|2007|pp=143–160}} It ends with the [[Confession of Peter]] and the Transfiguration.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=Transfiguration, The | encyclopedia=The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Thought: Son of Man-Tremellius V11 |isbn= 978-1-4286-3189-2 | publisher=Funk & Wagnalls Company | year=1909 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=js5-eDk13TcC&pg=PA493#v=onepage&q&f=false | page=493 | last=Nash | first=Henry S. | editor-first=Samuel M. | editor-last=Jackson}}</ref><ref name="Barton132">{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Gospels|first=Stephen C.|last= Barton |isbn= 978-0-521-80766-1 |pages= 132–133 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref>

As Jesus travels towards Jerusalem, in the [[Perea (Bible)|Perean]] ministry, he returns to the area where he was baptized, about a third of the way down from the [[Sea of Galilee]] along the Jordan ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#10:40|John 10:40–42]]).{{sfn|Cox|Easley|2007|p=137}}{{sfn|Redford|2007| pp= 211–229}} The [[Ministry of Jesus#Final ministry in Jerusalem|final ministry in Jerusalem]] begins with Jesus' [[triumphal entry into Jerusalem|triumphal entry]] into the city on [[Palm Sunday]].{{sfn|Cox|Easley|2007|pp=155–170}} In the Synoptic Gospels, during that week Jesus drives the money changers from the Temple and [[Bargain of Judas|Judas bargains to betray]] him.

==== Disciples and followers ====

Near the beginning of his ministry, Jesus [[Commissioning of the Twelve Apostles|appoints twelve apostles]]. In Matthew and Mark, despite Jesus only briefly requesting that they join him, Jesus' first four apostles, who were fishermen, are described as immediately consenting, and abandoning their nets and boats to do so ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#4:18|Matthew 4:18–22]], [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#1:16|Mark 1:16–20]]). In John, Jesus' first two apostles were disciples of John the Baptist. The Baptist sees Jesus and calls him the [[Lamb of God]]; the two hear this and follow Jesus.{{sfn|Brown|1988|pp= 25–27}}{{sfn|Boring|Craddock|2004|pages= 292–293}} In addition to the Twelve Apostles, the opening of the passage of the [[Sermon on the Plain]] identifies a much larger group of people as disciples ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#6:17|Luke 6:17]]). Also, in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#10:1|Luke 10:1–16]] Jesus sends [[Seventy disciples|seventy or seventy-two of his followers]] in pairs to prepare towns for his prospective visit. They are instructed to accept hospitality, heal the sick and spread the word that the Kingdom of God is coming.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=The Gospel According to Luke | encyclopedia=New Collegeville Bible Commentary: New Testament | publisher=Liturgical Press | year=2009 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sdooTRyPMCwC&pg=PA255#v=onepage&q&f=false | page=255 | first=Michael F. | last=Patella | editor-first=Daniel | editor-last=Durken | isbn=978-0-8146-3260-4}}</ref>

In Mark, the disciples are notably obtuse. They fail to understand Jesus' miracles (Mark 4:35–41, 6:52), his parables (Mark 4:13), or what "rising from the dead" would mean (Mark 9:9–10). When Jesus is later arrested, they desert him (see below).{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=285–296}}

In the Synoptics, Jesus teaches extensively, often in parables, about the Kingdom of God (or, in Matthew, the Kingdom of Heaven). The Kingdom is described as both imminent ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#1:15|Mark 1:15]]) and already present in the ministry of Jesus (Luke 17:21). Jesus promises inclusion in the Kingdom for those who accept his message (Mark 10:13–27). Jesus talks of the "Son of Man," an apocalyptic figure who would come to gather the chosen.<ref name="Britannica"/>

Jesus calls people to repent their sins and to devote themselves completely to God.<ref name="Britannica">{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/303091/Jesus-Christ |title=Jesus Christ | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate=June 10, 2015| first1=Ed P.|last1=Sanders |first2= Jaroslav J.| last2= Pelikan}}</ref> Jesus tells his followers to adhere to [[Jewish law]], although he is perceived by some to have broken the law himself, for example regarding the [[Sabbath]].<ref name="Britannica" /> When asked what the greatest commandment is, Jesus replies: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind&nbsp;... And a second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself" ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#22:37|Matthew 22:37–39]]). Other ethical teachings of Jesus include [[Matthew 5:44|loving one's enemies]], refraining from hatred and lust, and [[turning the other cheek]] ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#5:21|Matthew 5:21–44]]).<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LlMVrmA-b-4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Kingdom Ethics: Following Jesus in Contemporary Context | publisher=InterVarsity Press | year=2003 | pages=102–103, 138–140, 197–198, 295–298 | isbn=978-0-8308-2668-1 | first1=Glen H. |last1=Stassen |first2= David P. |last2=Gushee}}</ref>  In the Gospel of John, when an adulteress is about to be stoned to death in accordance with Moses' Law, the Pharisees ask Jesus what he will say in this situation, to which Jesus replied "Let anyone among you who has no sin be the first to throw a stone at her", causing the accusers to go away, and Jesus says to the woman that he does not condemn her for no one has, and tells her to not sin again ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#8:1|John 8:1-11]]).

John's Gospel presents the teachings of Jesus not merely as his own preaching, but as divine revelation. John the Baptist, for example, states in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#3:34|John 3:34]]: "He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure." In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#7:16|John 7:16]] Jesus says, "My teaching is not mine but his who sent me." He asserts the same thing in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#14:10|John 14:10]]: "Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells in me does his works."<ref name="autogenerated98" /><ref>{{cite book|title=The missions of Jesus and the disciples according to the Fourth Gospel| first=Andreas J.|last= Köstenberger|year= 1998| isbn= 978-0-8028-4255-8 |publisher=Wm.

But the one who does not have will be deprived even more.", going on to say that the majority of their generation have grown "dull hearts" and thus are unable to understand ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#13:10|Matthew 13:10-17]]).

In the gospel accounts, Jesus devotes a large portion of his ministry performing miracles, especially healings.{{sfn|Green|McKnight |Marshall|1992|p=299}} The miracles can be classified into two main categories: healing miracles and nature miracles.{{sfn|Twelftree|1999|p=350}} The healing miracles include cures for physical ailments, exorcisms, and resurrections of the dead.{{sfn|Green|McKnight|Marshall|1992|p=300}} The nature miracles show Jesus' power over nature, and include [[turning water into wine]], walking on water, and calming a storm, among others. Jesus states that his miracles are from a divine source. When Jesus' opponents suddenly accuse him of performing exorcisms by the power of [[Beelzebul]], the prince of demons, Jesus counters that he performs them by the "Spirit of God" ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#12:28|Matthew 12:28]]) or "finger of God", arguing that all logic suggests that Satan would not let his demons assist the Children of God because it would divide Satan's house and bring his kingdom to desolation; furthermore, he asks his opponents that if he exorcises by Beel'zebub, "by whom do your sons cast them out?"([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#11:20|Luke 11:20]]).<ref name="Britannica2">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Jesus Christ|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/303091/Jesus-Christ|accessdate=June 10, 2015|first1=Ed P.|last1=Sanders|first2=Jaroslav J.|last2=Pelikan}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Js9nFESO0VAC&pg=PA100#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Zondervan King James Version Commentary: New Testament|last2=Mitchell|first2=Daniel R.|publisher=Zondervan|year=2010|isbn=978-0-310-25150-7|page=100|first1=Edward E.|last1=Hindson}}</ref> In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#12:28|Matthew 12:31-32]], he goes on to say that while all manner of sin, "even insults against God" or "insults against the son of man", shall be forgiven, whoever insults goodness (or "The [[Holy Spirit]]") shall never be forgiven; he/she carries the guilt of his/her sin forever.

In the Synoptics, the last week in Jerusalem is the conclusion of the journey through Perea and [[Judea]] that Jesus began in Galilee.{{sfn|Cox|Easley|2007|pp=155–170}}
Jesus rides a young donkey into Jerusalem, reflecting an oracle from the [[Book of Zechariah]] in which the Jews' humble king enters Jerusalem this way (Zechariah 9:9).<ref name = "May Metzger Mark"/> People along the way lay cloaks and small branches of trees (known as palm fronds) in front of him and sing part of [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Psalms#118:25|Psalm 118:25–26]].{{sfn|Boring|Craddock|2004|pages=256–258}}{{sfn|Majerník|Ponessa|Manhardt|2005|pp=133–134}}{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=381–395}}

Jesus next expels the money changers from the Temple, accusing them of turning it into a den of thieves through their commercial activities. Jesus then prophesies about the coming destruction, including false prophets, wars, earthquakes, celestial disorders, persecution of the faithful, the appearance of an "abomination of desolation," and unendurable tribulations (Mark 13:1–23). The mysterious "Son of Man," he says, will dispatch angels to gather the faithful from all parts of the earth (Mark 13:24–27). According to Stephen L. Harris, Jesus warns that these wonders will occur in the lifetimes of the hearers (Mark 13:28–32).{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=285–296}} In John, the Cleansing of the Temple occurs at the beginning of Jesus' ministry instead of the end [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:13|John 2:13–16]].{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=302–310}}

The cheering crowds greeting Jesus as he enters Jerusalem add to the animosity between him and the establishment.{{sfn|Cox|Easley|2007|pp=155–170}} In John, Jesus has already cleansed the Temple during an earlier Passover visit to Jerusalem.

The Last Supper is the final meal that Jesus shares with his [[Twelve Apostles#The Twelve Apostles|12 apostles]] in Jerusalem before his crucifixion.

==== Agony in the Garden, betrayal, and arrest ====

After the Last Supper, Jesus takes a walk to pray, and then Judas and the authorities come and arrest him.
* In Mark, they go to the [[garden of Gethsemane]],{{sfn|Walvoord|Zuck|1983|pp=83–85}} where Jesus prays to be spared his coming ordeal. His disciples fall asleep while they should be watching (Mark 37–41). Then Judas comes with an armed mob, sent by the chief priests, scribes and elders.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=285–296}} He [[Kiss of Judas|kisses Jesus]] to identify him to the crowd, which then [[arrest of Jesus|arrests Jesus]].{{sfn|Walvoord|Zuck|1983|pp=83–85}} In an attempt to stop them, one of Jesus' disciples uses a sword to cut off the ear of a man in the crowd.{{sfn|Walvoord|Zuck|1983|pp=83–85}} After Jesus' arrest, his disciples go into hiding, and Peter, when questioned, thrice [[Denial of Peter|denies]] knowing Jesus.{{sfn|Walvoord|Zuck|1983|pp=83–85}} After the third denial, he hears the rooster crow and recalls the prediction as Jesus turns to look at him. Peter then weeps bitterly.<ref name="Denial"/>
* In Matthew, Jesus criticizes the disciple's attack with the sword, enjoining his disciples not to resist his arrest. He says, "[[Live by the sword, die by the sword|All who take the sword will perish by the sword]]" ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#26:52|Matthew 26:52]]).
* In Luke, Jesus goes to the [[Mount of Olives]] to pray,{{sfn|Walvoord|Zuck|1983|pp=83–85}} and Jesus miraculously heals the ear that a disciple severed (Luke 22:51).
* In John, Jesus does not pray to be spared his crucifixion, as the gospel portrays him as scarcely touched by such human weakness.{{sfn|Cross|2005 |loc=Jesus}} The people who arrest him are soldiers and Jewish officers (John 18:3). Instead of being betrayed by a kiss, Jesus proclaims his identity, and when he does, the soldiers and officers fall to the ground (John 18:4–7). The gospel identifies Peter as the disciple who used the sword, and Jesus rebukes him for it (John 18:10–11).

During the trials Jesus speaks very little, mounts no defense, and gives very infrequent and indirect answers to the priests' questions, prompting an officer to slap him.

Jesus' crucifixion is described in all four canonical gospels. After the trials, Jesus is led to [[Calvary]] [[Christ Carrying the Cross|carrying his cross]]; the route traditionally thought to have been taken is known as the [[Via Dolorosa]]. The three Synoptic Gospels indicate that [[Simon of Cyrene]] assists him, having been compelled by the Romans to do so.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=509–520}}{{sfn|Köstenberger|Kellum|Quarles|2009|pp=211–214}} In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#23:27|Luke 23:27–28]] Jesus tells the women in the multitude of people following him not to weep for him but for themselves and their children.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=509–520}} At Calvary, Jesus is offered a concoction usually offered as a painkiller.

The soldiers then crucify Jesus and [[Sortes (ancient Rome)|cast lots]] for his clothes. Above Jesus' head on the cross is Pilate's inscription, "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews"; soldiers and passersby [[Mocking of Jesus|mock]] him about it.

Prior to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the gospels were usually regarded as accurate historical accounts, but since then scholars have emerged who question the reliability of the gospels and draw a distinction between the Jesus described in the gospels and the Jesus of history.{{sfn|Levine|2006|p=5}} Since the 18th century, three separate scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during the quest that applied them.{{sfn|Witherington|1997|pp=9–13}}{{sfn|Powell|1998|pp=19–23}} While there is widespread scholarly agreement on the existence of Jesus,{{efn|name=exist}} and a basic consensus on the general outline of his life,<ref>[[Amy-Jill Levine]] in ''The Historical Jesus in Context'' edited by Amy-Jill Levine et al.

Most scholars agree that Jesus was baptized by John, debated with fellow Jews on how best to live according to God's will, engaged in healings and exorcisms, taught in parables, gathered male and female followers in Galilee, went to Jerusalem, and was crucified by Roman soldiers during the governorship of Pontius Pilate"</ref> the portraits of Jesus constructed in the quests have often differed from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospel accounts.<ref>''The Quest for the Plausible Jesus: The Question of Criteria'' by Gerd Theissen and Dagmar Winter (Aug 30, 2002) ISBN 0664225373 page 5</ref><ref>''Jesus Research: An International Perspective (Princeton-Prague Symposia Series on the Historical Jesus)'' by James H.

Approaches to the historical reconstruction of the life of Jesus have varied from the "maximalist" approaches of the 19th century, in which the gospel accounts were accepted as reliable evidence wherever it is possible, to the "minimalist" approaches of the early 20th century, where hardly anything about Jesus was accepted as historical.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Historical Jesus of the Gospels|first= Craig S.|last= Keener |year= 2012 | isbn= 978-0-8028-6292-1 |publisher=William B.

=== Judea and Galilee in the 1st century ===
[[File:Palestine in the time of Jesus.jpg|thumb|[[Judea]], [[Galilee]] and neighboring areas at the time of Jesus|alt=A map. See description]]
In AD 6, Judea, Idumea, and Samaria were transformed from a client kingdom of the Roman Empire into an imperial province. A Roman prefect, rather than a client king, ruled the land. The prefect ruled from Caesarea, leaving Jerusalem to be run by the high priest. As an exception, the prefect came to Jerusalem during religious festivals, when religious and patriotic enthusiasm sometimes inspired unrest or uprisings. Gentile lands surrounded the Jewish territories of Judea and Galilee, but Roman law and practice allowed Jews to remain separate legally and culturally. Galilee was evidently prosperous, and poverty was limited enough that it did not threaten the social order. Jewish religion was unusual in that Jews acknowledged only one God, they considered themselves chosen by him, and they wanted Gentiles to accept their God as the only God. Jews based their faith and religious practice on the Torah, five books said to have been given by God to Moses. The three prominent religious parties were Pharisees, Essenes, and Sadducees. Together these parties represented only a small fraction of the population. Most Jews looked forward to a time that God would deliver them from their pagan rulers, possibly through war against the Romans.<ref name = "Britannica150916">Sanders, E.P.

Historians face a formidable challenge when they analyze the canonical Gospels.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=263}}
The Gospels are not biographies in the modern sense, and the authors explain Jesus' theological significance and recount his public ministry while omitting many details of his life.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=263}}
The reports of supernatural events associated with Jesus' death and resurrection make the challenge even more difficult.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=263}}
Historians regard the gospels as compromised sources of information because the writers were trying to glorify Jesus.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=3}}
Even so, the sources for Jesus' life are better than sources historians have for the life of Alexander the Great.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=3}}
Scholars use a number of criteria, such as the [[criterion of multiple attestation|criterion of independent attestation]], the [[Biblical criticism#Coherence|criterion of coherence]], and the [[criterion of discontinuity]] to judge the historicity of events.{{sfn|Rausch|2003|pp=36–37}} The historicity of an event also depends on the reliability of the source; indeed, the gospels are not independent nor consistent records of Jesus's life. Mark, which is most likely the earliest written gospel, has been considered for many decades the most historically accurate.<ref>{{cite book|title=John, Jesus, and History, Volume 2|year=2007|publisher=Society of Biblical Lit|isbn=978-1-58983-293-0|page=291|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ryybidJYMAQC&pg=PA291#v=onepage&q&f=false |first1= Paul N.|last1= Anderson|first2= Felix |last2=Just |first3= Tom|last3= Thatcher}}</ref> John, the latest written gospel, differs considerably from the Synoptic Gospels, and thus is generally considered less reliable, although more and more scholars now also recognize that it may contain a core of older material as historically valuable as the Synoptic tradition or even more so.<ref>{{cite book|title=John, Jesus, and History, Volume 2|year=2007|publisher=Society of Biblical Lit|isbn=978-1-58983-293-0|page=292|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ryybidJYMAQC&pg=PA291#v=onepage&q&f=false |first1= Paul N.|last1= Anderson|first2= Felix |last2=Just |first3= Tom|last3= Thatcher}}</ref>

The non-canonical Gospel of Thomas might be an independent witness to many of the Jesus' parables and aphorisms. For example, Thomas confirms that Jesus blessed the poor and that this saying circulated independently before being combined with similar sayings in the Q document.{{sfn|Funk|Hoover|1993|pp=471–532}} Other select non-canonical Christian texts may also have historical value.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=17–62}}

Early non-Christian sources that attest to the historical existence of Jesus include the works of the historians Josephus and [[Tacitus]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|editor-last=Bockmuehl |editor-first= Markus N.

Non-Christian sources are valuable in two ways. First, they show that even neutral or hostile parties never evince any doubt that Jesus actually existed. Second, they present a rough picture of Jesus that is compatible with that found in the Christian sources: that Jesus was a teacher, had a reputation as a miracle worker, had a brother James, and died a violent death.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998}}

Archeology helps scholars better understand Jesus' social world.{{sfn|Reed|2002|p=18}} Recent archeological work, for example, indicates that Capernaum, a city important in Jesus' ministry, was poor and small, without even a forum or an [[agora]].<ref name=Gowler>{{cite book |title=What are they saying about the historical Jesus?|first=David B. |last=Gowler |year=2007| isbn= 978-0-8091-4445-7|publisher=Paulist Press| page= 102}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Jesus and archaeology |editor-first= James H.|editor-last= Charlesworth |year=2006 |isbn= 978-0-8028-4880-2 |page= 127 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QoIS7VApH6cC&pg=PA127#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Wm.

Most scholars agree that Jesus was a Galilean Jew,<ref name="Vermes 1981">{{cite book |title= Jesus the Jew: A Historian's Reading of the Gospels|edition= |last= Vermes|first= Geza|year= 1981|publisher= First Fortress|location= Philadelphia|isbn= 0-8006-1443-7 |pages= 20, 26, 27, 29}}</ref> born around the beginning of the first century, who died between 30 and 33 AD in [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]].<ref name=Humphreys1992/> The general scholarly consensus is that Jesus was a contemporary of [[John the Baptist]] and was crucified by the Roman governor Pontius Pilate, who held office from 26 to 36 AD.{{sfn|Levine|2006|p=4}}

The gospels offer several clues concerning the year of Jesus' birth. [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#2:1|Matthew 2:1]] associates the birth of Jesus with the reign of [[Herod the Great]], who died around 4 BC, and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#1:5|Luke 1:5]] mentions that Herod was on the throne shortly before the birth of Jesus,{{sfn|Maier|1989|pp=115–118}}{{sfn|Niswonger|1992|pp=121–122}} although this gospel also associates the birth with the [[Census of Quirinius]] which took place ten years later.{{sfn|Köstenberger|Kellum|Quarles|2009|pp=137–138}}{{sfn|Niswonger|1992|pp=122–124}} [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:23|Luke 3:23]] states that Jesus was "about thirty years old" at the start of his [[ministry of Jesus|ministry]], which according to [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#10:37|Acts 10:37–38]] was preceded by John's ministry, itself recorded in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:1|Luke 3:1–2]] to have begun in the 15th year of [[Tiberius]]' reign (28 or 29 AD).{{sfn|Niswonger|1992|pp=121–122}}<ref name="Vermes2006">{{cite book | first = Géza | last = Vermes | title = The Nativity: History and Legend | publisher = Random House Digital | year = 2010|pages=81–82 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=a9EiEU_Yz_kC&pg=PA81#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=978-0-307-49918-9}}</ref> By collating the gospel accounts with historical data and using various other methods, most scholars arrive at a date of birth between 6 and 4 BC for Jesus,<ref name="Vermes2006"/>{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=324}} but some propose estimates that lie in a wider range.{{efn|For example, John P. Meier states that Jesus' birth year is ''c.'' 7/6 BC,<ref name=Meier1991/> while Finegan favors ''c.'' 3/2 BC.<ref name=Finegan/>}}

The years of Jesus' ministry have been estimated using several different approaches.{{sfn|Köstenberger |Kellum|Quarles|2009|p=140}}{{sfn|Freedman|2000|p=249}} One of these applies the reference in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:1|Luke 3:1–2]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#10:37|Acts 10:37–38]] and the dates of Tiberius' reign, which are well known, to give a date of around 28–29 AD for the start of Jesus' ministry.{{sfn|Maier|1989|pp=120–121}} Another approach uses the statement about the temple in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:13|John 2:13–20]], which asserts that the [[Jerusalem Temple|temple in Jerusalem]] was in its 46th year of construction at the start of Jesus' ministry, together with [[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XV|Josephus' statement]] that the temple's reconstruction was started by Herod in the 18th year of his reign, to estimate a date around 27–29 AD.{{sfn|Köstenberger|Kellum|Quarles|2009|p=140}}{{sfn|Maier|1989|p=123}} A further method uses the date of the [[death of John the Baptist]] and the marriage of [[Herod Antipas]] to [[Herodias]], based on the writings of Josephus, and correlates it with [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#14:4|Matthew 14:4]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#6:18|Mark 6:18]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Craig |last=Evans|year= 2006| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wMbEyeDSQQgC&pg=PA55#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Josephus on John the Baptist| encyclopedia=The Historical Jesus in Context |editor-last1=Levine|editor-last2=Allison|editor-first3=John D.|editor-last3=Crossan|publisher=Princeton University Press| isbn= 978-0-691-00992-6 |pages=55–58| editor-first=Amy-Jill| editor2-first=Dale C.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Herodias: at home in that fox's den|first= Florence M.|last= Gillman |year=2003| isbn= 978-0-8146-5108-7| pages=25–30 |publisher= Liturgical Press}}</ref> Given that most scholars date the marriage of Herod and Herodias as AD 28–35, this yields a date about 28–29 AD.{{sfn|Freedman|2000|p=249}}

Most scholars agree that he died between 30 and 33 AD.<ref name=Humphreys1992/>{{sfn|Köstenberger|Kellum|Quarles|2009|p=398}} The gospels state that the event occurred during the prefecture of Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea from 26 to 36 AD.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=81–83}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Green |first=Joel B. |title=The gospel of Luke: New International Commentary on the New Testament Series |year= 1997 |publisher=Wm.

Historians have reached a limited consensus on the basics of Jesus' life.<ref name=White/>

====Family====
{{see also|Brothers of Jesus}}
Jesus was Jewish and born to Mary and Joseph.{{sfn|Ehrman|1993|p=98–99}} He grew up in Nazareth in Galilee.<ref>Sanders, E.P. [http://www.britannica.com/biography/Jesus-Christ#toc223005 Jesus Christ]. Encyclopedia Britannica Online. Retrieved September 20, 2015.</ref> 
Leading scholars such as [[Bart Ehrman]], [[E. P. Sanders]], and [[Géza Vermes]] generally consider Joseph to be Jesus' father.<ref name="Vermes 1981 283">{{cite book |title= Jesus the Jew: A Historian's Reading of the Gospels|edition= |last= Vermes|first= Geza|year= 1981|publisher= First Fortress|location= Philadelphia|isbn= 0-8006-1443-7|page= 283}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title= The Historical Figure of Jesus|edition= |last= Sanders|first= E.

Jesus also had brothers and sisters.{{sfn|Ehrman|1993|p=98–99}} 
The natural assumption is these offspring resulted from Joseph and Mary having sex, contrary to Catholic tradition.{{sfn|Ehrman|1993|p=98–99}}
It is unusual that in Mark 6:3, Jesus' neighbors refer to Jesus as Mary's son, because sons were identified by their fathers.<ref>[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]] and the [[Jesus Seminar]]. ''The acts of Jesus: the search for the authentic deeds of Jesus.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1998. p. 85. Funk calls this usage "striking".</ref>
This reference has led some scholars to suggest that Jesus was illegitimate and that Joseph is a fictional character.<ref>[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]] and the [[Jesus Seminar]]. ''The acts of Jesus: the search for the authentic deeds of Jesus.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1998. p. 85, 499. Specific scholars are not named in either reference.</ref>
Mary's identity as a historical figure, however, is certain.<ref>[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]] and the [[Jesus Seminar]]. ''The acts of Jesus: the search for the authentic deeds of Jesus.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1998. p. 85. "Mary was undoubtedly the name of Jesus' mother."</ref>
Joseph may well have died by the time Jesus' career began, but several of the earliest sources report that Mary outlived Jesus.{{sfn|Ehrman|1993|p=98–99}}

It is common for extraordinary charismatic leaders, such as Jesus, to come into conflict with their ordinary families.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=194}}
In Mark, Jesus' family comes to get him, fearing that he is mad (Mark 3:20–34), and this account is likely historical because early Christians wouldn't have invented it.<ref name="ActJMark"/>
John also reports that Jesus' brothers did not believe him (John 7:5).<ref name = "ActJMark"/>
After Jesus' death, many members of his family joined the Christian movement and enjoyed positions of respect within it.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=194}}
His brother James served as a leader in the Jerusalem.<ref>"James, St." Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005</ref>
James may have had a change of heart after having a vision of the resurrected Jesus (1 Corinthians 15:7).<ref name = "ActJMark"/>

Stories of Jesus' birth, along with other key events, have so many mythic elements that some scholars have suggested that Jesus himself was a myth.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=113–115}}
Historians say that the doctrine of Jesus' virgin birth arose from theological development rather than from historical events.<ref name="Vermes 1981 283"/> 
Michael Coogan says that Paul considered Jesus to have been begotten by Joseph.<ref>Coogan, Michael. God and Sex: What the Bible Really Says 2010.. p. 38</ref>

According to E. P. Sanders. the birth narratives in Matthew and Luke are the clearest case of invention in the Gospel narratives of Jesus' life. Both accounts have Jesus born in Bethlehem, in accordance with Jewish salvation history, and both have him growing up in Nazareth, but, he says, the two Gospels report completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened. Luke's account of a census in which everyone returned to their ancestral cities is not plausible. Matthew's account is more plausible, but the story reads as though it was invented to identify Jesus as like a new Moses, and the historian Josephus reports Herod's brutality without ever mentioning that he massacred little boys.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=85–88}}

The two different genealogies in Matthew and Luke each show Jesus as a direct descendant of King David, one of Jesus' main predecessors in salvation history.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=80–91}} According to E. P. Sanders, both genealogies are based not on historical information but on the authors' desire to show that Jesus was the universal Jewish savior.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=80–91}} Jesus' family may have considered themselves to be descended from the House of David, but it is impossible to say.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=194}} In any event, once the doctrine of Jesus' virgin birth became established, that tradition superseded the earlier tradition that he was descended from David through Joseph.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=196}}

Luke reports that Jesus was related to John the Baptist, but scholars general consider this connection to be invented.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=80–91}}<ref name = "ActJBirth">[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]] and the [[Jesus Seminar]]. ''The acts of Jesus: the search for the authentic deeds of Jesus.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1998. "Birth & Infancy Stories" p. 497-526.</ref>

====Baptism and John the Baptist====
Most modern scholars consider Jesus' baptism to be a definite historical fact, along with his crucifixion.{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=339}} James D.G. Dunn states that they "command almost universal assent" and "rank so high on the 'almost impossible to doubt or deny' scale of historical facts" that they are often the starting points for the study of the historical Jesus.{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=339}} Scholars adduce the [[criterion of embarrassment]], saying that early Christians would not have invented a baptism that might imply that Jesus committed sins and wanted to repent.{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=47}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Catherine|title=John the Baptist: Prophet of Purity for a New Age|year=2003|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-5933-5|pages=29–30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=so_G78SBXAoC&pg=PA29#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>

John's ministry was one of many renewal movements that sought to strengthen Judaism against the pressure of Hellenistic influence.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=144-147}} His movement was unusual in that it opposed the Jewish leadership rather than the Roman occupiers.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=144-147}} He was the first of many 1st-century prophets who raised hopes for divine intervention.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=144-147}} Jesus was inspired by John and took over from him many elements of his teaching.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=235}} Jesus' teaching, however, emphasized grace and forgiveness over judgment.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=235}}

====Ministry in Galilee====
Most scholars hold that Jesus lived in Galilee and Judea and did not preach or study elsewhere.<ref name=Dunn303>{{cite encyclopedia|title=The Spirit-Filled Experience of Jesus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=37uJRUF6btAC&pg=PA303#v=onepage&q&f=false|first=Marcus J. |last=Borg |encyclopedia=The Historical Jesus in Recent Research|editor-last1= Dunn |editor2-last=McKnight|year= 2006 |isbn= 978-1-57506-100-9 |page= 303|editor-first=James D.G. |publisher= Eisenbrauns |editor2-first=Scot}}</ref>
They agree that Jesus debated with Jewish authorities on the subject of God, performed some healings, taught in parables and gathered followers.{{sfn|Levine|2006|p=4}} According to E. P. Sanders, Jesus may well have debated other Jews about how to interpret the Law and the Sabbath, as recorded in the Synoptics.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=205–223}} Sanders, however, concludes that it is not plausible that these disagreements would have led Jewish authorities to want Jesus killed, as the Synoptics report.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=205–223}}

Parables are considered characteristic of Jesus' teaching.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=316–346}} While Jewish rabbinical writing includes many parables, it is noteworthy that Jesus made extensive use of parables.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=316–346}} Jesus' parables about the Kingdom of God used striking and original imagery, such as likening it to a tiny mustard seed or to leaven.<ref name = "5GIntro"/> Christians have taught that Jesus' parables are superior to those of rabbinical Judaism, but historically speaking the parables are largely similar.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=316–346}} Historians distinguish between parables and allegories found in the Synoptics.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=316–346}} The parables are Jesus' original form, and the allegorical meanings associated with them originated among early Christians.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=316–346}} Jesus' parables were accessible to all with no hidden meanings, like a common fable.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=316–346}} As allegories, however, they are more like secret apocalyptic literature.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=316–346}}

As recorded in the Synoptics, Jesus taught that coming kingdom was everyone's proper focus, not anything in this life.{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=167–170}} He taught about the Jewish Law, seeking its true meaning, sometimes in opposition to other traditions.{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=164–167}} He put love at the center of the Law, and following that Law was an apocalyptic necessity.{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=164–167}} His ethical teachings called for forgiveness, not judging others, loving enemies, and caring for the poor.{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=171–176}} Typical of Jesus were paradoxical or surprising turns of phrase, such as advising one, when struck on the cheek, to offer the other cheek to be struck as well (Luke 6:29).<ref>[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]], Roy W. Hoover, and the [[Jesus Seminar]]. ''The five gospels.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1993. p. 294</ref> Jesus' Jewish critics considered his ministry to be scandalous because he feasted with sinners, fraternized with women, and allowed his followers to pluck grain on the Sabbath.<ref name = "5GIntro"/>

The Gospels portray Jesus teaching in well-defined sessions, such as Matthew's Sermon on the Mount or Luke's parallel Sermon on the Plain. According to Gerd Theissen and Annette Merz, these teaching sessions include authentic teachings of Jesus, but the scenes were invented by the respective evangelists to frame these teachings, which had originally been recorded without context.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=17–62}}

Jesus was an exorcist, as demonstrated by [[Graham H.

First, he attributed them to the faith of those healed. Second, he connected them to end times prophecy.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=310}} Jesus' healings were long considered literally true and sometimes dismissed as fraudulent, but today an understanding of psychosomatic therapy leads more people to believe that faith healing could be possible.<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Jesus_(persons_in_the_Bible).aspx#1 "Jesus of Nazareth."] Encyclopedia of World Biography. 2004. Retrieved 29 Dec 2015.</ref>

Historians say Jesus called disciples as part of his ministry.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=10}} Jesus chose twelve disciples (the "Twelve"), evidently as an apocalyptic message.{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|p=186–187}} All three Synoptics mention the Twelve, although the names on Luke's list vary from those in Mark and Matthew, suggesting that Christians weren't sure who all the disciples were.{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|p=186–187}} E. P. Sanders says that 12 may have been a symbolic number, and that the number of actual disciples might have varied.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=120}} The twelve disciples represented the twelve original tribes of Israel, which would be restored once God's rule was instituted.{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|p=186–187}} The disciples were reportedly meant to be the rulers of the tribes in the coming Kingdom (Matthew 19:28, Luke 22:30).{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|p=186–187}} According to Bart Ehrman, Jesus' promise that the Twelve would rule is historical because the Twelve included Judas, and no Christians would have invented a line from Jesus promising rulership to the disciple who betrayed him.{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|p=186–187}}
In Mark, the disciples play hardly any role other than a negative one. While other sometimes respond to Jesus with complete faith, his disciples are puzzled and doubtful.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=123–124}} They serve as a foil to Jesus and to other characters.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=123–124}} The failings of the disciples are probably exaggerated in Mark, and the disciples make a better showing in Matthew and Luke.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=123–124}}

According to Gerd Theissen and Annette Merz;{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=113-115}} and [[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]], Roy W. Hoover, and the [[Jesus Seminar]],<ref name = "5GMark">[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]], Roy W. Hoover, and the [[Jesus Seminar]]. ''The five gospels.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1993. "Mark," p 39-127.</ref> Jesus' Transfiguration is considered mythical. Some critics say that the scene actually represents a vision of Jesus after his death retrospectively incorporated into the narrative of Jesus' life.<ref>”Transfiguration." Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005</ref> According to Theissen and Merz, epiphanies such as the Transfiguration are based on experiences that Christians had after Jesus's death rather than during his life.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=296}} The divine voice declaring Jesus to be God's son seems to have originally been associated with Jesus' resurrection (see Romans 1:3 and Acts 13:33).{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=554}} Even if the story is based an a genuine vision, it has been sufficiently reworked in light of early Christian beliefs, making it effectively Mark's invention.<ref>[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]] and the [[Jesus Seminar]]. ''The acts of Jesus: the search for the authentic deeds of Jesus.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1998. p. 105–106</ref>

E, P. Sanders says that Jesus' mission was not about repentance, although he acknowledges that this opinion is unpopular. He argues that repentance appears as a strong theme only in Luke, that repentance was John the Baptist's message, and that Jesus' ministry would not have been scandalous if the sinners he ate with had been repentant.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=230–236}} According to the general opinion, Jesus taught that God was generously giving people an opportunity to repent.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=336}}

====Role====
Jesus taught that an apocalyptic figure, the "Son of Man," would soon come on clouds of glory to gather the elect, or chosen ones (Mark 13:24-27, Matthew 24:29-31, Luke 21:25-28). He referred to himself as a "[[son of man]]" in the colloquial sense of "a person," but historians don't know whether he also meant himself when he referred to the heavenly "Son of Man." Paul and other early Christians interpreted the "Son of Man" as the risen Jesus.<ref name="Britannica" />

The title Christ, or Messiah, indicates that Jesus' followers believed him to be the anointed heir of King David, whom some Jews expected to save Israel. The Gospels refer to him not only as a Messiah but in the absolute form as "the Messiah" or, equivalently, "the Christ." In early Judaism, this absolute form of the title is not found, but only phrases such as "his Messiah". The tradition is ambiguous enough to leave room for debate as to whether Jesus defined his eschatological role as that of the Messiah.{{sfn|Cross|2005 |loc=Messiah}} The Jewish messianic tradition included many different forms, some of them focused on a Messiah figure and others not.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=533-540}} Based on the Christian tradition, [[Gerd Theissen]] advances the hypothesis that Jesus saw himself in messianic terms but did not claim the title "Messiah."{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=533-540}} Bart Ehrman argues that Jesus did consider himself to be the Messiah, albeit in the sense that he would be the king of the new political order that God would usher in,<ref>{{cite web|last=Ehrman|first= Bart|url= http://ehrmanblog.org/judas-and-the-messianic-secret/ |title=Judas and the Messianic Secret|website= The Bart Ehrman Blog|date=December 1, 2015}}</ref> not in the sense that most people today think of the term.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ehrman|first= Bart|url= http://ehrmanblog.org/jesus-claim-to-be-the-messiah/ |title=Jesus' Claim to be the Messiah|website= The Bart Ehrman Blog|date=December 1, 2015}}</ref>

====Passover and crucifixion in Jerusalem====
Around AD 30, Jesus and his followers traveled from Galilee to Jerusalem to observe Passover.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=10}} While in Jerusalem, he reportedly undertook three symbolic acts before being arrested and executed as a threat to the public order.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=249–275}}

First, Jesus caused a disturbance in the Temple,{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=11}} which was the center of Jewish religious and civil authority. E. P. Sanders associates it with Jesus' prophecy that the Temple would be totally demolished.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=254–262}}

Second, Jesus had a last meal with his disciples, which is the origin of the Christian sacrament of bread and wine. Jesus' words are recorded in the Synoptics and in Paul's epistle 1 Corinthians. The differences in the accounts cannot be completely reconciled, and it is impossible to know what Jesus intended, but in general the meal seems to point forward to the coming Kingdom. Jesus probably expected to be killed, and he may have hoped that God would intervene.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=263–264}}

The Gospels say that Jesus was betrayed to the authorities by a disciple, and many scholars consider this report to be highly reliable.{{sfn|Cross|2005|loc=Jesus Christ}} He was executed on the orders of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=11}} Pilate most likely saw Jesus' reference to the Kingdom of God as a threat to Roman authority and worked with the Temple elites to have Jesus executed.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=465–466}} The Sadducean high-priestly leaders of the Temple more plausibly had Jesus executed for political reasons than for his teaching.{{sfn|Cross|2005|loc=Jesus Christ}} They may have regarded him as a threat to stability, especially after he caused a disturbance at the Temple.{{sfn|Cross|2005|loc=Jesus Christ}}<ref name="JE1906"/> Other factors, such as Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, may have contributed to this decision.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=269-273}} Most scholars consider Jesus' crucifixion to be factual because early Christians would not have invented the painful death of their leader.{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=339}}{{sfn|Meier|2006|pp=126–128}}

====After crucifixion====
[[File:The Resurrection Beaufort arms in border (f. 131) Cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|The Resurrection of Christ from a 16th-century copy of ''La Passion de Nostre Seigneur'']]
After Jesus' death, his followers said he rose from the dead, although exact details of their experiences are unclear. Some of those who claimed to have witnessed Jesus' resurrection later died for their belief, which indicates that their beliefs were likely genuine.{{sfn|Sanders|1993}} According to [[E. P. Sanders]], the Gospel reports contradict each other, which, according to him, suggests competition among those claiming to have seen him first rather than deliberate fraud.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=276-281}} On the other hand, [[L. Michael White]] suggests that inconsistencies in the Gospels reflect differences in the agendas of their unknown authors.<ref name=White/> The followers of Jesus formed a community to wait for his return and the founding of his kingdom.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=11}}

It seems as though the first people to hail Jesus as the Son of God were early Christians who believed that he had been exalted to that status at his resurrection (see Romans 1:3 and Acts 13:33). [[Gerd Theissen]] and [[Annette Merz]] state that this faith that Jesus was the Son of God was then written into Jesus' biography at his Transfiguration and his Baptism (Mark), birth (Matthew and Luke), and pre-existence (John and Paul).{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=113–115, 554-556}}

=== Portraits of Jesus ===
{{Main article|Historical Jesus}}
Modern research on the historical Jesus has not led to a unified picture of the historical figure, partly because of the variety of academic traditions represented by the scholars.{{sfn|Theissen|Winter|2002|pp=4–5}} Given the scarcity of historical sources, it is generally difficult for any scholar to construct a portrait of Jesus that can be considered historically valid beyond the basic elements of his life.{{sfn|Köstenberger|Kellum|Quarles|2009|pp=117–125}}{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=22–23}} The portraits of Jesus constructed in these quests often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospels.{{sfn|Theissen|Winter|2002|p=5}}{{sfn|Cross|2005 |loc=Historical Jesus, Quest of the}}

Contemporary scholarship, representing the "third quest," places Jesus firmly in the Jewish tradition. Leading scholars in the "third quest" include [[E. P. Sanders]], [[Geza Vermes]], [[Gerd Theissen]], Christoph Burchard, and [[John Dominic Crossan]]. Jesus is seen as the founder of, in the words of E. P. Sanders, a '"renewal movement within Judaism." This scholarship suggests a continuity between Jesus' life as a wandering charismatic and the same lifestyle carried forward by followers after his death. The main criterion used to discern historical details in the "third quest" is the criterion of plausibility, relative to Jesus' Jewish context and to his influence on Christianity. The main disagreement in contemporary research is whether Jesus was apocalyptic. Most scholars conclude that he was an apocalyptic preacher, like John the Baptist and the apostle Paul. In contrast, certain prominent North American scholars, such as [[Burton Mack]] and John Dominic Crossan, advocate for a non-eschatological Jesus, one who is more of a [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] sage than an apocalyptic preacher.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=1–15}} In addition to portraying Jesus as an [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic prophet]], a charismatic healer or a [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynic philosopher]], some scholars portray him as the true Messiah or an egalitarian prophet of social change.<ref name=CambHist23>{{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Christianity| volume= 1 |first1= Margaret M.|last1= Mitchell |first2= Frances M. |last2=Young |year= 2006| isbn= 978-0-521-81239-9|publisher=Cambridge University Press| page= 23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6UTfmw_zStsC&pg=PA23#v=onepage&q&f=false }}</ref>{{sfn|Köstenberger|Kellum|Quarles|2009|pp=124–125}} However, the attributes described in the portraits sometimes overlap, and scholars who differ on some attributes sometimes agree on others.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=Why Study the Historical Jesus? | encyclopedia=Handbook for the Study of the Historical Jesus | publisher=Brill | year=2011 | first=Colin | last=Brown | page=1416 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LuKMmVu0tpMC&pg=PA1416#v=onepage&q&f=false | isbn=978-90-04-16372-0 | editor1-first=Tom | editor1-last=Holmen | editor2-first=Stanley E. | editor2-last=Porter }}</ref>

Since the 18th century, scholars have occasionally put forth that Jesus was a political national messiah, but the evidence for this portrait is negligible. Likewise, the proposal that Jesus was a Zealot does not fit with the earliest strata of the Synoptic tradition.{{sfn|Cross|2005|loc=Jesus Christ}}

=== Christ myth theory ===
{{Main article|Christ myth theory}}
The [[Christ myth theory]] is the hypothesis that [[Jesus of Nazareth]] never existed; or if he did, that he had virtually nothing to do with the founding of Christianity and the accounts in the [[gospels]].<ref>[[Bart Ehrman]], ''Did Jesus Exist?'' Harper Collins, 2012, p. 12, ""In simpler terms, the historical Jesus did not exist . Or if he did, he had virtually nothing to do with the founding of Christianity." further quoting as authoritative the fuller definition provided by [[Earl Doherty]] in ''Jesus: Neither God Nor Man.'' Age of Reason, 2009, pp. vii-viii: it is "the theory that no historical Jesus worthy of the name existed, that Christianity began with a belief in a spiritual, mythical figure, that the Gospels are essentially allegory and fiction, and that no single identifiable person lay at the root of the Galilean preaching tradition."</ref> 
[[Bruno Bauer]] (1809–1882) taught that the first Gospel was a work of literature that produced history rather than described it.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=90}} 
According to [[Albert Kalthoff]] (1850–1906) a social movement produced Jesus when it encountered Jewish messianic expectations.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=90}} 
[[Arthur Drews]] (1865–1935) saw Jesus as the concrete form of a myth that predated Christianity.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=90}}

Apart from his own disciples and followers, the Jews of Jesus' day generally rejected him as the Messiah, as do the great majority of Jews today.

[[Christian sect]]s and [[Christian schisms|schisms]] have often been defined or characterized by their descriptions of Jesus.

In the 20th century, Protestant groups became sharply divided in terms of how much they support historical and critical inquiry into the person of Jesus. Protestant denominations allow some such investigation but differ in how far the investigation may go. The Roman Catholic Church drew definite limits, and Catholic scholars have engaged in considerable critical study within those limits.<ref name=Britannica />

<!-- The info from here should probably be cited.
The depiction of Jesus in art took several centuries to reach a conventional standardized form for his physical appearance, which has subsequently remained largely stable since that time. Most images of Jesus have in common a number of traits which are now almost universally associated with Jesus, although variants are seen.

The image of a fully bearded Jesus with long hair did not become established until the 6th century in [[Eastern Christianity]], and much later in the West. Earlier images were much more varied. Images of Jesus tend to show ethnic characteristics similar to those of the culture in which the image has been created. Beliefs that certain images are historically authentic, or have acquired an authoritative status from Church tradition, remain powerful among some of the faithful, in Eastern Orthodoxy, Anglicanism, and Roman Catholicism. The [[Shroud of Turin]] is now the best-known example, although the [[Image of Edessa]] and the [[Veil of Veronica]] were better known in medieval times.!-->

Some of the earliest depictions of Jesus at the [[Dura-Europos church]] are firmly dated to before 256.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia  |editor-last1=Attridge |editor-first2= Gohei |editor-last2= Hata |encyclopedia=Eusebius, Christianity, and Judaism |publisher= Wayne State University Press |year= 1992 |pages=283–284 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=jVyzbHAJ_hAC&pg=PA283#v=onepage&q&f=false |first=Joseph |last=Gutmann |title=Early Christian and Jewish Art  |isbn=0814323618|editor-first=Harold W.}}</ref> Thereafter, despite the lack of biblical references or historical records, a wide range of depictions of Jesus appeared during the last two millennia, often influenced by cultural settings, political circumstances and theological contexts.{{sfn|Houlden|2006|pp=63–99}}<ref name=Erricker44 >{{cite book|title=Teaching Christianity: a world religions approach|first= Clive|last= Erricker|year= 1987 |isbn= 978-0-7188-2634-5 |page= 44 |publisher=James Clarke & Co}}</ref><ref name="Perkinson30"/> As in other [[Early Christian art]], the earliest depictions date to the late second or early third century, and surviving images are found especially in the [[Catacombs of Rome]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The New Westminster Dictionary of Church History|first= Robert |last=Benedetto|year= 2006| isbn= 978-0-664-22416-5 |pages= 51–53 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press}}</ref>

Before the Protestant Reformation, the [[crucifix]] was common in Western Christianity. It is a model of the cross with Jesus crucified on it. The crucifix became the central ornament of the altar in the 13th century, a use that has been nearly universal in Roman Catholic churches until recent times.{{sfn|Cross|2005 |loc=Crucifix}}

Jesus appears as an infant in a manger (feed trough) in Christmas creches, which depict the Nativity scene.<ref name="EB16032015"/> He is typically joined by Mary, Joseph, animals, shepherds, angels, and the Magi.<ref name="EB16032015"/> [[Francis of Assisi]] (1181/82–1226) is credited with popularizing the creche, although he probably did not initiate it.<ref name="EB16032015"/> The creche reached its height of popularity in the 17th and 18th centuries in southern Europe.<ref name="EB16032015">"Creche."

The [[Renaissance]] brought forth a number of artists who focused on depictions of Jesus; [[Fra Angelico]] and others followed [[Giotto]] in the systematic development of uncluttered images.{{sfn|Houlden|2006|pp=63–99}}

The [[Protestant Reformation]] brought renewed [[aniconism in Christianity|resistance to imagery]], but total prohibition was atypical, and Protestant objections to images have tended to reduce since the 16th century.

The total destruction that ensued with the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|siege of Jerusalem]] by the Romans in AD 70 made the survival of items from first century Judea very rare and almost no direct records survive about the history of Judaism from the last part of the first century through the second century.{{sfn|Levine|2006|p=24-25}}<ref name=Koester382>[[Helmut Koester]] ''Introduction to the New Testament'', Vol. 1: History, Culture, and Religion of the Hellenistic Age.
