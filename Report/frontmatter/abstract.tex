Linking is vital for navigation on the World Wide Web and provides structure to individual documents. We present the problem of suggesting missing links on Wikipedia in order to structurally improve Wikipedia as a whole. Based on approaches taken by related work, we choose to focus on structural analysis of Wikipedia as a graph. We then formulate the problem as a supervised binary classification problem. We populate a graph database with Wikipedia articles as nodes and article links as edges. We use a feature learning approach, node2vec, to generate features for a classifier based on the Wikipedia link graph. The final solution achieves a precision score of $0.981$ on our test set containing featured articles. Other tests show that the solution does not generalize to the whole of Wikipedia.
