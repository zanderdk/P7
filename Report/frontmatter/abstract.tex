We present the problem of suggesting missing links on Wikipedia. Based on approaches taken by related work, we choose to focus on structural analysis of Wikipedia as a graph. We then formulate the problem statement as a supervised binary classification problem. We populate a graph database with Wikipedia articles as nodes and page links as edges. Because of limited time and domain knowledge, we use a feature learning approach, node2vec, to generate features for a classifier based on the Wikipedia link graph. The final solution achieves a ?? score of ?? on 20\% of Wikipedia.
