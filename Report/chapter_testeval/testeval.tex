\chapter{Test \& Evaluation}\label{chap:testeval}
This chapter is dedicated to evaluate the performance of our proposed solution. We will describe the methodology of the tests, and interpret the results.

\section{Methodology}
We test the classifier model by predicting links on data samples that has not been part of the training data, and deriving a result based on an evaluation metric.

As described in \cref{sec:training_data} the test data consists of 20\% of all data samples.



\todo{we want to use a custom loss function that penalizes false negatives, but this is only easy in keras. This is however okay if we reason about how much better this custom log function makes the predictions, and then make sure to mention using custom log functions for the other classifiers as future work}
