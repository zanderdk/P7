\chapter{Analysis}\label{chap:idea}
In this chapter we will devise an idea to solve the problem of finding missing links on Wikipedia. This involves an analysis of the problem domain and of what methods are possible to use.

  \item In \sectionref{sec:analconsiderations} we summarize why this problem is non-trivial.

\section{Considerations}\label{sec:analconsiderations}
The main problem making this project non-trivial is the fact that Wikipedias guidelines for linking~\cite{wiki-manual-of-style-overlinking} are a matter of judgment. 

\todo{Dette kan bruges som motivation for at bruge MI / learn-by-examples:} 
There is no clear definition of what a ``good'' or ``bad'' link is. However, we have plenty of examples of what a ``good'' link is.
Wikipedia maintains a collection of articles that are deemed outstanding examples and are considered to be the best Wikipedia has to offer. These are called \emph{featured articles}~\cite{wiki-featured-articles} and there are almost 5000 of these. These articles follow the Wikipedia Policies and Guidelines~\cite{wiki-editor-guidelines}, which also means they follow the guidelines for linking. We can therefore assume that they link appropriately.
