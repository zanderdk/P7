\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:conclusion}
This project addressed the problem of supplying reasonable suggestions of links, that should be added to Wikipedia articles. Wikipedia contains a large amount of articles, and each day articles are created and existing are edited. To ensure the high quality of Wikipedia, relationships (links) between articles have to be maintained. Otherwise, the easy way of navigating Wikipedia by links in articles would be impaired. Quality control is required for this task, but this is a daunting task for any single human editor. As such, Wikipedia employs a community based approach. 

We present a method of automating this process. The system is designed and implemented with scalability in mind. It automatically finds suggestions of articles that should be linked, and presents these to a user. The user can then decide whether or not the suggestion was appropriate. As such, we leave the ultimate decision in the hands of the user, since we recognize that our system has not been tested to the extent, that allows us to say with confidence that it works autonomously in most cases.

In the problem statement, we formulated the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item List from introduction...
\end{itemize}

\todo{How we answered these. One paragraph for each point.}
