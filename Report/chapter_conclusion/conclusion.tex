\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:conclusion}
This project addressed the problem of supplying reasonable suggestions of links, that should be added to Wikipedia articles. Wikipedia contains a large amount of articles, and each day articles are created and existing are edited. To ensure the high quality of Wikipedia, relationships (links) between articles have to be maintained. Otherwise, the easy way of navigating Wikipedia by links in articles would be impaired. Quality control is required for this task, but this is a daunting task for any single human editor. As such, Wikipedia employs a community based approach. 

We present a method of automating this process. The system is designed and implemented with scalability in mind. It automatically finds suggestions of articles that should be linked, and presents these to a user. The user can then decide whether or not the suggestion was appropriate. As such, we leave the ultimate decision in the hands of the user, since we recognize that our system has not been tested to the extent, that allows us to say with confidence that it works autonomously in most cases.

In the problem statement, we formulated the following questions:

\section{Future Work}
\todo{intro}

\subsection{Candidate Generator}
The candidate generation step of the system provides article pairs to be classified. For this reason the relevance of the selected candidates directly impacts which links are being suggested. In the future it would be useful to examine methods for increasing the likelihood that relevant links are selected, while still keeping the amount of irrelevant candidates down to a manageable level.

\subsection{Training Data}
The training data can be improved \todo{explain classifier eval}. Because the negatives are selected at random, the training data contains very few \enquote{edge} cases, where articles have high relevance but still should not be linked. Extending the data which such samples could improve accuracy of the classifier. Additionally it might be useful to extend the data with training samples for linking in the opposite direction, since we do not know to which extend the direction between pairs of articles is being considered.
Furthermore the amount of training data might not be sufficient or general enough. One way to increase the amount of training data might be to also consider links from good articles as positives, even though we cannot assume them to have good linking.

% non-featured
Both the training and test data does not take non-featured articles into account. This might be a problem since featured articles might not be a good representation of normal articles. In the future it would be relevant to examine how the model can be trained to evaluate article pairs that are not featured. One way might be to use input from editors, which is discussed below. Other approaches could be to use a n-gram or clickstream data as mentioned in \todo{ref}.

As mentioned in \cref{sec:db} we currently have \num{11159213} articles in our dataset. The majority of these articles are automatically generated pages with less or no content. Pruning these articles from the data would probably improve the feature model, because it could avoid traversing these during graph walks.

\subsection{Realtime Data}
The used Wikipedia data was collected in 2015. A future improvement would be to consider the newest available Wikipedia data, to be able to suggest links that has not already been inserted.
By working on realtime Wikipedia data, the system could be improved to suggest links for recently edited and added articles. This would be beneficial for editors, since new articles are likely to be missing links.

\subsection{Reinforcement Learning}
The system could also be extended to take user input into account, by training on samples that editors have assigned as good or bad suggestions.

\subsection{User Interface}
% UI
The user interface is very good. \todo{ui}

\subsection{Automatic Link Insertion}
An improvement would be to automatically insert suggested links in articles and make it possible for editors to accept the appropriate ones.

If the system is improved to have a high confidence for suggesting links, it would also be relevant to consider creating a Wikipedia bot that automatically can insert suggested links, which significantly would decrease the workload required by editors.
