\todo{tjek brug af ``hyperlink'' vs ``link''}

The World Wide Web is built on the idea of \emph{``creating a space in which anything could be linked to anything''}~\cite[p.~4]{Weaving-the-web}. Hyperlinking can thus be seen as a vital component that is critical to the success of the World Wide Web. Hyperlinking permits easy navigation on websites, enabling users to quickly find relevant  information. From social media messages to publicly available databases of technical data, the World Wide Web provides an unprecedented amount of information, which is made readily available through easily navigable hyperlinks.

Wikipedia is a prominent example of a website where hyperlinking is an important aspect. This free, online encyclopedia is built on the principle that anyone can edit its articles~\cite{wiki-about}. As of October 2016, the English version of Wikipedia consists of more than 5.2 million articles~\cite{wiki-about}, that are edited about \num{150000} times per day~\cite{wiki-num-edits}, and about 800 new articles are added each day~\cite{wmcharts}. With this scale of information, hyperlinks are essential in connecting knowledge scattered over the many articles. Considering the community based approach and the large body of work on Wikipedia, quality control is a rather daunting task. No single editor can keep up with the vast number of changes, new articles, and changing relationships between articles. To assist the editors, many mundane and repetitive tasks are performed by bots, such as notifying editors of mismatched parentheses, vandalism detection, or copyright violation on new pages~\cite{wiki-bots}. Bots are, however, not able to autonomously correct all errors, and as such manual verification performed by individual authors is still required~\cite{wiki-bot-policy}.

Linking between Wikipedia articles is an important issue that editors and authors have to handle. In an attempt to ensure high quality article interlinking, Wikipedia has a set of guidelines regarding linking between articles~\cite{wiki-editor-guidelines}. One of the concerns these guidelines mention is the problem of \emph{overlinking}. In most contexts overlinking is, for example, linking to everyday words understood by most readers, major geographic locations, common units of measurement, and dates. In addition, a link should generally appear only once in an article. Since links tend to compete for attention~\cite{hyperlink-structure-using-logs}, the guidelines suggest that links should only be used to improve understanding of a given article. Because of this, it is not enough to check whether a given article is being mentioned, but semantic and contextual analysis is also required. While this analysis is in many cases easy for a human author, it might be more difficult for computers. This project will explore ways for a software solution to assist editors and authors in linking Wikipedia articles.
