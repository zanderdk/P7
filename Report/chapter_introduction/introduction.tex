\chapter{Introduction}
The World Wide Web is built upon the idea of \emph{creating a space in which anything could be linked to anything} \todo{insert cite: Weaving the Web, chapter 1 by Tim Berners-Lee}. Thus, hyperlinking can be seen as a vital component of the World Wide Web, and even a critical component to its success. Hyperlinking allows websites to be easily navigationable, enabling users to quickly find relevant or in-depth information.

Considering a large website, finding pairs of pages that should be linked may be a difficult task, especially for humans. Hyperlinks need to be relevant and add value for a user browsing the website.
