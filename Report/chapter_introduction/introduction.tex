\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}
%\todo{Kasper:Wikipedia bliver lidt introduceret som 'et tilfældigt eksempel', så derfra er det mindre åbentlyst hvorfor vi vælger at gå videre med wiki. Det er som om vi kunne have taget en tilfældig 'large' side. Jeg vil have sagt: Information er nice > Wikipedia har information (og er ikke onde) > Hvis vi kan hjælpe wiki er det nice > vi kan lave links}
One of the ideas upon which The World Wide Web is built is \emph{creating a space in which anything could be linked to anything}~\cite[ch.~1, p.~4]{Weaving-the-web}. Hyperlinking can thus be seen as a vital component of the World Wide Web and even a critical component to its success. Hyperlinking permits websites to be easily navigationable, enabling users to quickly find relevant or in-depth information. From social media messages to publicly available databases of technical data, The World Wide Web provides access to an unprecedented amount of information, which is made readily available through easy navigationable hyperlinks.

A prominent example of a website combining both hyperlinking and access to information is Wikipedia. Wikipedia is a free, online encyclopedia built on the principle that anyone can edit its articles. As of October 2016 the English version of Wikipedia consists of more than 5.2 million articles~\cite{wiki-about} and has about 150.000 edits per day~\cite{wiki-num-edits}, as well as about 800--900 new articles per day~\cite{wmcharts}. Considering the community based approach and the large body of work on Wikipedia, quality control is a rather daunting task for any human editor; no editor can keep up with the vast number of changes and number of new articles and their relationship with other old or new articles. As such many bots run through the site carrying out repetitive and mundane tasks, ranging from vandalism detection to notifying editors of mismatched parentheses~\cite{wiki-bots}.

There are however still many problems left unsolved, and one of these problems is the matter of linking articles to each other. In an attempt to ensure the good quality of this interlinking of articles, Wikipedia has a set of guidelines regarding linking between articles~\cite{wiki-manual-of-style-overlinking}. However, these guidelines are very vague and merely provide examples of do's and don'ts. % Yes, this is a widely accepted way of spelling do's and don'ts
This makes it particularly hard to automatize with a bot. On the other hand, this area would likely benefit from automation, since the size of Wikipedia makes it difficult to do manually.

\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problem_statement}
In this project, we will try to answer the following question:

\begin{formal}
How can an agent be developed which given a Wikipedia article can suggest link candidates to other Wikipedia articles?
\end{formal}
%How can we develop an agent that, given a Wikipedia article, can suggest link candidates to other relevant Wikipedia articles?

Expanding on the problem statement, this project will consist of two parts:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item Identify relevant missing links; and
  \item present these to a user
\end{enumerate*}. 
The technically interesting part of this project mainly lies in the first part. Identifying relevant missing links is not a trivial task, and we will spend most of our time tackling this problem. Not entirely dismissing a presentation to a user, but it will not be our main focus.

% Goals and study regulation
An important goal of this semester project is, of course, to conform to the requirements of the study regulation. The study regulation clearly states, that we should be able to demonstrate knowledge about and have the ability to develop an internet application, agent or service. And GUI! \todo{Tør vi overhovedet svare på om vi opfylder studieordningen?}
