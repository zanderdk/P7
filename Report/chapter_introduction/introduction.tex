\chapter{Introduction}
The World Wide Web is built upon the idea of \emph{creating a space in which anything could be linked to anything} \cite[ch.~1, p.~4]{Weaving-the-web}. Thus, hyperlinking can be seen as a vital component of the World Wide Web, and even a critical component to its success. Hyperlinking allows websites to be easily navigationable, enabling users to quickly find relevant or in-depth information.

Considering a large website, finding pairs of pages that should be linked may be a difficult task, especially for humans. Hyperlinks need to be relevant and add value for a user browsing the website. Some websites allow many different users to edit the content of pages, including the hyperlinks. This further complicates the task of maintaining a good link structure, as the users might differ in opinon on the relevance of certain hyperlinks~\cite{ellis1994measurement}.

Wikipedia is a good example of a website where maintaining the link structure is both important and difficult. Properly linking between articles is important, as it facilitates easy acces to other relevant articles, that might contain necessary background knowledge. Articles on Wikipedia are authored and edited by many different users, who have to decide what articles should be linked. In an attempt to ensure a good link structure, Wikipedia has a set of guidelines regarding linking between articles~\cite{wiki-editor-guidelines}. It is however still difficult for editors to decide when an article is relevant enough to warrant linking.

\section{Problem Statement}

In this project, we will try to answer the following question:

\begin{formal}
How can an agent be developed which given a Wikipedia article can suggest link candidates to other Wikipedia articles?
\end{formal}

%How can we develop an agent that, given a Wikipedia article, can suggest link candidates to other relevant Wikipedia articles?

% Goals and study regulation
The main goal of this semester project is, of course, to conform to the requirements of the study regulation. The study regulation clearly states, that we should be able to demonstrate knowledge about and have the ability to develop an internet application, agent or service.

Expanding on the problem statement, this project will consist of two parts:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item Identify relevant missing links; and
  \item present these to a user
\end{enumerate*}.
