\chapter{Introduction}
\todo{Kasper:Wikipedia bliver lidt introduceret som 'et tilfældigt eksempel', så derfra er det mindre åbentlyst hvorfor vi vælger at gå videre med wiki. Det er som om vi kunne have taget en tilfældig 'large' side. Jeg vil have sagt: Information er nice > Wikipedia har information (og er ikke onde) > Hvis vi kan hjælpe wiki er det nice > vi kan lave links}
One of the ideas upon which The World Wide Web is built is \emph{creating a space in which anything could be linked to anything} \cite[ch.~1, p.~4]{Weaving-the-web}. Thus, hyperlinking can be seen as a vital component of the World Wide Web, and even a critical component to its success. Hyperlinking allows websites to be easily navigationable, enabling users to quickly find relevant or in-depth information.

%Another cornerstone of The World Wide Web is accessability of knowledge and information. \todo{cite}. From social media messages to publicly available databases of technical data, The World Wide Web provides people with access to an unpresidented amount of information.

%Perhaps the most prominent example of a website combining both hyperlinking and access to information is Wikipedia. Wikipedia functions as an online encyclopedia built upon the principle that anyone can edit the articles within. This has caused Wikipedia to grow to a massive size, with more than 5 million articles in the english edition alone. {cite} The articles are connected through hyperlinks, which allow the users to navigate from one article to another by clicking on the terms of subjects they wish to read about.

%But considering the community based aproach and the large body of work on Wikipedia, quality control is a rather daunting task for any human editor, and as such, multiple bots run through the site checking different things, ranging from vandalism to simply telling editors that they have mis-matched some brackets.

%There are however still many problems left unsolved, and one of these problems is the matter of inter-linking articles.

Considering a large website, finding pairs of pages that should be linked may be a difficult task, especially for humans. Hyperlinks need to be relevant and add value for a user browsing the website. Some websites allow many different users to edit the content of pages, including the hyperlinks. This further complicates the task of maintaining a good link structure, as the users might differ in opinon on the relevance of certain hyperlinks~\cite{ellis1994measurement}. \todo{lidt uenig med nogle af påstandene i denne paragraf}

Wikipedia is a good example of a website where maintaining the link structure is both important and difficult. Properly linking between articles is important, as it facilitates easy acces to other relevant articles, that might contain necessary background knowledge. Articles on Wikipedia are authored and edited by many different users, who have to decide what articles should be linked. In an attempt to ensure a good link structure, Wikipedia has a set of guidelines regarding linking between articles~\cite{wiki-editor-guidelines}. It is however still difficult for editors to decide when an article is relevant enough to warrant linking. \todo{Kasper: I stedet for at fokusere på at det er svært at vælge, så påpej at det er svært at finde frem til de steder hvor links mangler. Tror ikke vores agent kan blive 'bedre' end en given editor. Det er i hvert fald svært at påstå. gælder både for 2. og 3. paragraf.}

\section{Problem Statement}

In this project, we will try to answer the following question:

\begin{formal}
How can an agent be developed which given a Wikipedia article can suggest link candidates to other Wikipedia articles?
\end{formal}

%How can we develop an agent that, given a Wikipedia article, can suggest link candidates to other relevant Wikipedia articles?

% Goals and study regulation
The main goal of this semester project is, of course, to conform to the requirements of the study regulation. The study regulation clearly states, that we should be able to demonstrate knowledge about and have the ability to develop an internet application, agent or service. \todo{Kasper: jeg er ikke enig i at 'main goal' er at overholde study ordningen}

Expanding on the problem statement, this project will consist of two parts:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item Identify relevant missing links; and
  \item present these to a user
\end{enumerate*}.
