\section{Problem Statement}\label{sec:problem_statement}
We believe that the existence of a system that helps editors improve the quality of the links in Wikipedia articles, will benefit Wikipedia and thereby ultimately its readers.

The use of machine learning for predicting links in a structural setting is not an unexplored concept, as~\cite{tang2015line} and~\cite{al2006link} are two examples of. It is however, an approach we have not seen used to a large extent in related work concerning Wikipedia. Due to this, we wish to explore the idea of using machine learning techniques to improve linking on Wikipedia through a graph-based approach.

Specifically, the problem we will attempt to solve in this project can be formulated as such:

\begin{formal}
How can a system be developed that supports Wikipedia editors by suggesting potential article links using machine learning on a graph structure?
\end{formal}

In order to better approach this problem, we identify a list of subproblems that enables us to focus on the different aspects involved:

\begin{itemize}
  \item How can Wikipedia articles be modeled as a graph, such that relevant information on linking is included?
  \item How can machine learning be used to suggest potential articles links, that would improve article quality?
  \item How can Wikipedia editors be presented with suggestions of article links that could be included?
\end{itemize}

%The answer to the problem of whether two articles should be linked is inherently subjective --- there is no definitive answer to this problem. Therefore, the focus of our project will be on article link suggestions, instead of definitive answers.
