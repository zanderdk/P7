\section{Report Organization}
In this report we propose a solution for the above problem, based on an analysis of different solution ideas and techniques. We also cover the design and implementation process of our solution. Afterwards, we cover the evaluation of the developed system, and finally conclude on the project as a whole. As such, the report is organized in the following fashion:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \cref{chap:analysis} covers the problem analysis in terms of data modeling, machine learning definitions, the generation of features.
  \item \cref{chap:design} describes the design and implementation of the system. First, we present an overview of the system architecture, before describing the individual components.
  \item \cref{chap:testeval} describes the test and evaluation of the system. We present the results and discuss them. Furthermore, the user interface is tested.
  \item \cref{chap:conclusion} concludes on the problem statement and subquestions. Furthermore we present areas which could be the subject of future work.
  \item \cref{chap:reflection} reflects upon the project in terms of lessons learned throughout the project period. Also it contains a description and reflection on the development method used.
