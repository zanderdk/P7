\chapter{Methodology}\label{chap:analysis}

In this chapter we discuss the methods we use in solving the problem defined in \cref{sec:problem_statement}. In the problem statement we delimited our solution domain to machine learning on a graph structure. We now explore different aspects of this solution domain and its possibilities, before finally proposing the solution idea we will pursue.

We start by defining the underlying graph structure, before we explore the problem of applying machine learning techniques. To accompany this, we discuss approaches to generating features.
