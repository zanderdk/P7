\chapter{Analysis}\label{chap:analysis}
In this chapter we devise an idea to solve the problem of finding missing links on Wikipedia. 
%Wikipedia is the subject of multiple papers and research projects~\cite{wiki-research-newsletter}.
%This report will investigate whether we can use computers to automate finding missing links on Wikipedia articles, in order to allow the user to focus on other parts of article authoring. %The linking problem, namely whether two articles should be linked, is not easy to define in an objective manner, as it is inherently subjective; there is no definitive answer to this problem.
To find missing links, we need to mimic how the contributors link articles together. In other words, we want to learn how to link articles together by looking at the current use of links. This is essentially the idea of machine learning, which we will be the main part of our solution idea. The following sections will expand on this idea in-depth.
