\chapter{Methodology}\label{chap:analysis}

In this chapter we compose a solution idea which will attempt to answer the problem previously stated. First we will draw inspiration from solutions to related problems, and delimit our solution domain to machine learning. Then we will explore different aspects of this solution domain and its possibilities, before finally proposing the solution idea we will pursue.
