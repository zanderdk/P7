\chapter{Methodology}\label{chap:analysis}

In this chapter we discuss and compose a solution which will attempt to answer the problem previously stated. In \cref{related_machine_learning}, we delimited our solution domain to machine learning. We will now explore different aspects of this solution domain and its possibilities, before finally proposing the solution idea we will pursue.

Before we explore the problem of using machine learning on graph structures, we will define the underlying graph structure. This is a matter of choosing what nodes and edges represent. With a graph defined, we explore machine learning, and to accompany that, we discuss approaches to generating features.
