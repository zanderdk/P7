\chapter{Initial Analysis}\label{chap:analysis}
Before beginning the work we need a preliminary understanding of the problem domain. This requires information acquisition related to Wikipedia and its data, as well as analyzing the needs for storage.

\section{Considerations}
The main problem making this project non-trivial is the fact that Wikipedias guidelines for linking~\cite{wiki-manual-of-style-overlinking} are a matter of judgment. There is no clear definition of what a ``good'' or ``bad'' link is. However, we have plenty of examples of what a ``good'' link is.
Wikipedia maintains a collection of articles that are deemed outstanding examples and are considered to be the best Wikipedia has to offer. These are called \emph{featured articles}~\cite{wiki-featured-articles} and there are almost 5000 of these. These articles follow the Wikipedia Policies and Guidelines~\cite{wiki-editor-guidelines}, which also means they follow the guidelines for linking. We can therefore assume that they link appropriately.
