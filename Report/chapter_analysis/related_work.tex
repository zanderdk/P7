Before we can draw inspiration from solutions to related problems, we must consider what our problem is. As with almost all problems, this problem can be perceived from multiple angles, and modeled by just as many.

First, the linking problem can be seen as a problem of relation or relatedness.



%To find missing links, our idea is to mimic how the contributors on Wikipedia link articles together. In other words, we want to learn how to link articles together by looking at how links are currently inserted/not inserted. This is is essentially the idea of machine learning, which we will be the main part of our solution idea. The following sections will expand on this idea in-depth.




%Wikipedia is the subject of multiple papers and research projects~\cite{wiki-research-newsletter}.


%Because of the subjective guidelines, we need to mimic how the contributors link articles together by looking at how they are currently linked. This is essentially the idea of machine learning, which we will be the main part of our solution idea. This chapter will analyze this aspect.
