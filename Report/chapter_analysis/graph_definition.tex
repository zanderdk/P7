\section{Graph Definition}
This section expands on the concept of good links and defines a formal definition of a graph. Ideally, good links should be links that adhere to the Wikipedia guidelines on linking~\cite{wiki-manual-of-style-guidelines}. Even with the guidelines, it can still be a challenge for an author to link correctly. However, Wikipedia maintains a collection of articles that are deemed outstanding examples and are considered to be the best Wikipedia has to offer. These are called \emph{featured articles}~\cite{wiki-featured-articles} and there are almost 5000 of these. The featured articles follow the Wikipedia Policies and Guidelines~\cite{wiki-editor-guidelines}, which also means they follow the guidelines for linking. We can therefore assume that they link appropriately. While we can not assume that every example of good linking is covered, the featured articles provide a sizable set of good examples. This means that the edges in our graph are page links from articles. The links from featured articles are considered good, while all other links are of undetermined quality.

In order to formally define the graph we first define a binary relation $$\Rightarrow\ =\ \{\ (a,b)\ |\ \text{article } a \text{ has a link to article } b\ \}$$

Later on we will use the infix notation $$a\ \Rightarrow\ b \text{ meaning } (a,b) \in\ \Rightarrow,$$ $$a\ \not\Rightarrow\ b \text{ meaning } (a,b) \not\in\ \Rightarrow$$

We can formally define our graph as a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ where $V$ is the set of all Wikipedia articles, and $\Rightarrow\ = E\subset\ V \times V$.
