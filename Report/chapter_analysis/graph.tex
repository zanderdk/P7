\section{Network Structuring}
\todo{måske bedre titel}
In this section we will describe how and why we have chosen to structure the Wikipedia netowrk information as a Graph. \todo{beskriv hvorfor vi vælger graph}
In order to define the graph we first define a binary relation $\Rightarrow\ =\ \{\ (a,b)\ |\ \text{article } a \text{ has a link to article } b\ \}$. Later on we will use the infix notation $a\ \Rightarrow\ b$ meaning $(a,b) \in\ \Rightarrow$ as well as $a\ \not\Rightarrow\ b$ meaning $(a,b) \not\in\ \Rightarrow$.
We chose to model the link graph as directed $G = (V,E)$ where V is the set of all Wikipedia articles, and $E\ \subset\ V \times V =\ \Rightarrow$.
