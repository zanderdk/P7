\chapter{Design \& Implementation}\label{chap:design}
In this chapter we discuss the development of the solution that was outlined in the previous chapter. The system will be explained in a top-down fashion. After a brief overview of the system, the rest of the chapter will describe the specifics of each component in separate sections.

\section{Architecture}\label{sec:design_overview}
This system is developed following a pipeline architecture, where the output of each component is fed into the next, illustrated in \cref{fig:system-overview}. The main benefit of this architecture is the modularity and scalability. Each component has minimal coupling with each other, by only interacting through data. As long as two components both adhere to the same protocol, they can completely disregard any logic or functionality of each other. This gives the system the two advantageous properties of effortless exchange of entire components and straightforward horizontal scaling.

If system usage grows sufficiently large the data exchange could be handled by intermediate databases using, for example, a master-slave architecture where components supplying data could write to the database through one of multiple masters, and components retrieving data could read from one of multiple slaves \todo{GØR NOGET!!!!}. It is also possible to distribute components across different machines. While this might not be a computational advantage, it minimizes logistics problems during scaling operations, since the system can be partially moved, component by component. Shutdown of a component can be delayed until its replacement is running. Regardless of the specific implementations, the pipeline architecture makes it possible to upscale specific components when bottlenecks emerge.

\subsection{Main Pipeline}
\todo{Forklar intro til main pipeline} The main pipeline consists of five components. The first component, \emph{Database}, stores the information required to identify the link suggestions. The second component is \emph{Candidate Generator}, which extracts candidate article pairs from the database. The third component is the \emph{Feature Extractor}. This component uses a feature learning approach to generate a feature vector for any given candidate pair. The fourth component is the \emph{Classifier}, which is responsible for the classification of the candidate pair. Finally the \emph{Results Pool} stores the suggestions until they are presented to a user through the user interface.

\subsection{Support Modules}
The main pipeline requires the inclusion of a feature learning model, used for extracting article features, as well as learning a classification model by training a classifier to suggest links from the the extracted features. These tasks are performed by two support modules.

The support module for the \emph{Feature Extractor} component consists of a \emph{Feature Learner} and a \emph{Parameter Optimizer}. The \emph{Parameter Optimizer} tunes the parameters of the feature learning algorithm. When an acceptable set of parameters has been found, the \emph{Feature Learner} uses these parameters to train the final model, used in the \emph{Feature Extractor}.

The other support module is for the \emph{classifier}. It consists of the \emph{Training Data Generator} and the \emph{Classifier Trainer}. The \emph{Training Data Generator} retrieves the labeled training pairs from the \emph{Database} component, and uses the \emph{Feature Extractor} to prepare the data. Then the \emph{Classifier Trainer} uses this prepared training data to learn a model, which is used as our classifier.

\subsection{User Interface}
Finally, we introduce the \emph{User Interface} component. Since the classifier can not be expected to reach a perfect precision, the final decision of whether to include a suggested link, should be done by a human editor. Therefore we create a user interface that allows Wikipedia editors access to the results of the main pipeline, such that they can use it in their editing process

We consider this component separate from the main pipeline, due to different requirements of the two parts. While both the user interface and the main pipeline share the goals of the entire system, they have different subgoals. The main pipeline is purely focused on producing results, and the user interface only considers the delivery of those results. This difference in subgoals warrants a different evaluation approach, and as such it is desirable to separate the user interface from the main pipeline.
