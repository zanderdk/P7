\chapter{Design \& Implementation}\label{chap:design}
In this chapter we discuss the development of the solution that was outlined in the previous chapter. The system will be explained in a top-down fashion. After a brief overview of the system, the rest of the chapter will describe the specifics of each component in their own separate sections.

\section{Architecture}\label{sec:design_overview}
This system is developed following a pipeline architecture, where the output of each primary component is fed into the next, illustrated in \cref{fig:system-overview}. The main benefit of this architecture is the modularity and scalability. Each component has minimal coupling with each other, by only interacting through data. As long as two components both adhere to the rules for data exchange, they can completely disregard any logic or functionality of each other. This gives the system the two advantageous properties of effortless exchange of entire components and straightforward horizontal scaling.

If system usage grows sufficiently large the data exchange could be handled by intermediate databases using, for example, a master-slave architecture where components supplying data could write to the database through one of multiple masters, and components retrieving data could read from one of multiple slaves. It is also possible to have every component run on different machines in different places. While this might not be a computational advantage, it minimizes logistics problems during scaling operations, since the system can be partially moved, component by component. Shutdown of a component can be delayed until its replacement is running. Regardless of the specific implementations, our usage of the pipeline architecture makes it possible to upscale specific components when bottlenecks emerge.

\subsection{Main Pipeline}
The main pipeline consists of five components. The first component, \emph{DB}, stores the information required to identify the link suggestions. The second component is \emph{Candidate Generator}, which extracts candidate article pairs from the database. The candidates are of the form $(a,b)$ where $a$ is a source article and $b$ is a suggested target article. The third component is the \emph{Feature Extractor}. This component generates a feature vector for a given candidate pair. As the fourth component, we have the \emph{Classifier}, which is responsible for the classification of the candidate pair. Finally the \emph{Results Pool} stores the suggestions until they are presented to a user through the user interface.

\subsection{Model Training}
Development of the main pipeline includes learning a feature model, used for extracting article features, as well as learning a classification model by training a classifier to suggest links from the the extracted features. These tasks are performed by two support modules.

The support module for the feature learning consists of a \emph{Model Trainer} and a \emph{Parameter Optimizer}. The \emph{Parameter Optimizer} tunes the parameters of the feature learning algorithm. When an acceptable set of parameters has been found, the \emph{Feature Learner} uses these parameters to train the final model. The result of this is the model, which is used as the \emph{Feature Extractor}.\todo{Ændret "Model Trainer" til "Feature Learner", er der et bedre navn?}\todo{Det er ikke blevet ændret særligt godt. Tjek dokument igennem for referencer (Ikke kun cref, men også bare i plain tekst)}

The other support module is for the classifier learning process. It consists of a \emph{Training Data Generator} and a \emph{Classifier Trainer}. The \emph{Training Data Generator} retrieves the labeled training pairs $P \cup U$ from the \emph{DB} component, and uses the \emph{Feature Extractor} to prepare the data. Then the \emph{Classifier Trainer} uses this prepared training data to create a model, which is used as our classifier.

\subsection{User Interface}
Finally, we cover the \emph{User Interface} component. The purpose of this component is to publish the results of the main pipeline to users who can then use the results to edit Wikipedia. Since the classifier can not be expected to reach a perfect precision, the final decision of whether to include a suggested link, should be done by a human editor. Therefore we create a user interface that allows people to retrieve the results of the main pipeline.

We consider this component separate from the main pipeline, due to different requirements of the two parts. While both the user interface and the main pipeline share the goals of the entire system, they have different subgoals. The main pipeline is purely focused on producing results, and the user interface only considers the delivery of those results. This difference in subgoals requires a different evaluation approach, and as such it is desirable to separate the user interface from the main pipeline.
