\section{Feature Extractor}
\todo{Maybe name this Feature Extraction?}
The feature extractor receives a pair of articles and extracts features from them based on a node2vec model that has been trained ahead of time. The feature pair are represented as two vectors which is combined using an operation such as multiplication \todo{maybe write that we always multiply them, cite node2vec paper, that says that multiplication yielded best results in their experiments.} and used as input for the AI.

\todo{Elaborate on node * node will give an edge representation, and whether or not * is used or another operator}
