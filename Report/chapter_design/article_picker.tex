\section{Candidate Generator}
The candidate generator component is responsible for providing an ordering of article pairs that are to be classified. The motivation behind this component and how we choose candidate pairs is described in this section.

The database contains roughly five million actual articles, which results in $2.5 \times 10^{13}$ article pairs\todo{Men vi bruger alle 11 mio?}. If we consider a brute force approach that randomly generates all article pair permutations, and assume that we can classify 1 million of these pairs per second, it will still take almost 290 days to classify all pairs\todo{Hvor fik vi lige det tal fra? Synes ikke vi kan bruge det argument}. Considering that the highest number of links on an article is currently 7130\todo{Har vi talt rigtigt? Altså kun outgoing?}\footnote{The article in question is \enquote{List of Places In Afghanistan}}, and that the brute force approach checks five million potential links, it is safe to assume that most of these article pairs will be classified as \enquote{do not link}\todo{Det kan vi også godt antage uden eksemplet + er eksemplet featured?}\todo{will be rejected / e.lign?}.

Therefore we want a more efficient selection method, that seeks to order the article pairs, in such a way that those which should be linked, will generally be evaluated in the pipeline before those article pairs that should not be linked\todo{Kan gøres kortere}. This task of efficiently selecting pairs is the problem which the candidate generator is given\todo{Sætning lyder ikke for godt}. A perfect ordering method would result in having all the article pairs that should be linked, occur before any article pair that should not be linked. While such a method would be helpful, it is unrealistic and only serves as a benchmark.

Instead of aspiring to create a perfect method, we only require the method to be a heuristic that performs reasonably well. The threshold for \enquote{reasonably well} is loosely defined as a method that generates a sufficient number of candidate pairs, such that the main pipeline produces enough suggestions for users to evaluate\todo{omformuler}. The problem here is that in order to evaluate the exact performance of a policy, we would need to know if the candidate pairs it suggests, will be classified mostly as \enquote{needs link}\todo{Kan vi skrive klassificeringen anderledes?}. Because such an evaluation of the candidate generator would produce the results of the classifier, it would in turn make the method obsolete for the tested pairs, since they would now have been classified. \todo{ikke den fede formulering. Lad dog vær med at bruge tid på dette før til aller sidst. Andre ting er vigtigere} Therefore we choose our method mainly from a combination of intuition and preliminary tests.

Our chosen method is a combination of two approaches. One is based on a \emph{clickstream} dataset and the other on a simple textual analysis.

\subsection{Clickstream Approach}\label{sec:candidate_clickstream}

The clickstream approach is inspired by related work that uses server logs to predict missing links~\cite{hyperlink-structure-using-logs}. We use clickstream~\cite{wiki-clickstream} data built from Wikipedia server logs, and as such it is based on user behavior. A clickstream data source is a list of requests that Wikipedia received within a given timespan\footnote{We use a data source collected from March 1 -- March 31, 2016}. A request holds information on a referrer and a resource, as well as a count of the occurrence of this request and a request type. The request type can be \emph{link}, \emph{external}, or \emph{other}. For this approach, the type \emph{other} is the only relevant one. A request of type \emph{other} means that the referrer and resource were both articles\todo{Wikipedia articles?}, but that referrer does not link to the resource. One source of this type of requests could be searches~\cite{wiki-clickstream}.

The heuristic for this approach, is that some of these requests will indicate that a user, after reading one article, was prompted to read another article, and that they did not have the possibility of following a link. While there are plenty of cases where this does not constitute a missing link, chances are that some of the requests are examples of this. The approach works by going through the clickstream data, picking out requests of type \emph{other}, and ranking them by their number of occurrences\todo{Ikke så glad for "works by"}.

Though preliminary results with this approach have been promising, it only produces a limited amount of candidate pairs (1.7 million)\todo{Hvor mange vil vi gerne have?}. Therefore, we choose to complement it with another approach to get a bigger set of candidate pairs.

\subsection{n-gram Approach}

For the complementary approach we took inspiration from~\cite{milne2008learning}, where they employ textual analysis to find article pairs. The inspiration lies in their use of n-grams to find article pairs. For each article we create a set of shingles from an n-gram search. We then search through the titles of Wikipedia articles, for ones that are contained in at least one of the shingles. This gives us a large set of article pairs $(a,b)$, where article $b$ mentions article $a$.
\todo{Hvorfor finder vi hvor b nævner a?}

However, this is a crude approach and a significant amount of the candidate pairs can easily be discarded. Consider the Wikipedia article on the word \enquote{the}. With the n-gram approach, nearly all 5.2 million articles would be in a candidate pair with this article, where only a fraction would be worth considering.

A way to combat this would be to order the candidate pairs according to the inverse frequency of target articles. The intuition is that articles, which are rarely mentioned across all articles, will be more significant when they \emph{are} mentioned. It is likely that a frequency threshold will be required, since the advantages of the approach becomes negligible at some sufficiently high frequency.
\todo{Ved ikke om vi skal nævne dette?}

Another considerable problem with the approach is that while it does provide many candidate pairs, it can not be guaranteed to order all possible pairs, and therefore it will not completely cover the complement of the clickstream approach. A preliminary test with a 5-gram search through featured articles gave us more than a million candidate pairs. When all articles are searched, this approach will generate significantly more than the clickstream approach. This will be sufficient for our usage, and further scaling will not be implemented in this project.

%from an article $a$ to an article $b$ in the time frame where the data was collected, as well as the method of navigation of these clicks. One of these methods of navigation is a \emph{teleportation}, which means the user ended up on article $b$ after having viewed article $a$, but not following a link.

%By selecting article pairs without an existing link and that users have navigated between by teleportation, the articles might be related and inserting a link between the articles might improve navigability.
